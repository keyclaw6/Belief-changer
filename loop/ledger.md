# Experiment Ledger

> The full story of every experiment the loop has run — written so a human (or
> a fresh agent) can read it top to bottom and understand not just *what
> happened* but *why*, and *what to try next*. This is the learning record of
> the whole campaign.
>
> **How it relates to the other records:**
> - `loop/results.tsv` — the canonical machine row (one line per iteration).
>   The verdict and lesson here are copied from it, never re-worded.
> - `loop/learnings.md` — the terse non-repeat log the *hypothesizer* reads.
> - **This file** — the explanation. Where you come to actually understand an
>   experiment and decide the next move.
>
> **Rules:** one entry per iteration, newest at the bottom. Append-only — never
> edit or reword a past entry; a correction is a new entry. Write for a reader
> who wasn't there: enough detail that the *reasoning* is visible, not just the
> outcome.

## Entry format

Each iteration gets an entry like this:

```markdown
### iter-NNN — <short title>  ·  <date>  ·  <KEEP | REVERT | INCONCLUSIVE | BASELINE>

**Hypothesis.** What we believed and why — the failure we were attacking and
the causal reasoning ("if we change X, gap Y closes because Z").

**Change.** Exactly what was done: the file, the section, and the nature of the
edit — enough that the diff is confirmable but the intent is stated in words.

**What happened.** The evidence. What the judges saw, what the traces showed,
whether the predicted cluster closed, and anything unexpected. Quote the
decisive finding, don't summarize it away.

**Verdict & why.** KEEP / REVERT / INCONCLUSIVE and the reasoning — including
whether the prediction was accurate, partial, or wrong.

**What we learned.** The durable lesson about the factory — copied verbatim
from the results.tsv lesson.

**What this opens next.** The direction this points to: the cluster to attack
next, the component level to move to if this one is spent, or the question this
raised. This is what makes the ledger tell you what to do next.
