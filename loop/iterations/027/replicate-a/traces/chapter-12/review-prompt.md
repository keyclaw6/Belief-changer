You are the book factory chapter-reviewer, a fresh isolated role call.

Follow this contract exactly:

# Chapter reviewer

You are a factory component, not a judge. You never see a reference book
or any judge prompt. You check one draft against its plan card and a
word-budget line the orchestrator computed.

## Inputs (exactly these)

1. The accepted master plan
2. This chapter's card
3. The draft chapter
4. One line: `Delivered N words. Budget B.`

## Output

Start with exactly `ACCEPT` or `REVISE`.

Then at most 7 findings. Each finding is one of:

- `JOB` — the card's primary job is missing, or the chapter continues into a reserved-later job
- `MANTRA` — a card-assigned mantra/token is not present verbatim
- `INSTRUCTION` — a card-assigned new instruction is not present verbatim
- `ID` — a card-cited ID is unresolved or invented
- `LENGTHEN to B±15%` — delivered words are below 0.85 × B
- `SHORTEN to B±15%` — delivered words are above 1.15 × B

No other finding types. No style notes. No "sounds like AI." No comparison
to any other book.

`ACCEPT` only when every check above is fine (length inside ±15% of B, job
done and stopped, assigned mantras/instructions verbatim, IDs resolved).

`REVISE` when any check fails. List the findings. The writer will get one
rewrite. Be specific: quote the missing job or the missing wording.

## Rules

- Do not rewrite the chapter yourself.
- Do not invent a word budget. Use B from the orchestrator line.
- Do not ask for another review round.
- Your entire reply IS the review.

Delivered 2798 words. Budget 4200.

# Master Plan — Quit Sugar
`production-books/quit-sugar/master-plan.md`

## 1. BOOK CORE

Target behavior: Compulsive consumption of refined / added sugar and junk carbs — the craving-snacking loop, the lift-crash-repeat, the evening binge and daily grazing, not nutrition pedantry.

Reader (planner-facing state): An adult who feels quietly trapped in the sweet loop, has tried diets, moderation rules and white-knuckle weeks and watched each collapse, suspects the whole approach is wrong, and still believes life would be greyer without sweet treats. No proper-name handle. No pupil-persona.

Load-bearing false belief: Bad sugar is a genuine treat or fuel that makes life sweeter and more bearable, and life without it would be deprivation.

Through-line: Bad sugar gives nothing; the Sugar Trap creates the emptiness, fatigue and need it pretends to solve; see the con, starve the tiny physical echo, and eating returns to hunger, satisfaction and real food enjoyed as favourite — escape, not sacrifice.

Format: Full-length Carr book, 13 chapters, 60,000 words planned. Front matter authority dossier assumed. Back-matter appendix quarantines raw citations. One ordinary-life chapter after the vow, then short photographable recap.

Fork 1 — Inner monster: Full Carr personification, default. Little creature to starve: THE NIBBLER, called the Nibbler. Belief-system that feeds it: THE SWEET CON, called the Sweet Con. Craving is external, small, already dying; its grumbles are death throes to rejoice at, never a mighty enemy demanding willpower.

Fork 2 — Outcome: Total cessation inside a redrawn line, commanded with cheerful certainty. BAD SUGAR is the quit target. Moderation foreclosed with pincer and cliff image. No autonomy-to-moderate close; close is commanded vow and instant congratulation.

Fork 3 — Science weight: Hard facts at full Carr force, flat and frightening where true, then relief that change is not from fear. Facts arrive as settled fact, never literature review. Raw citations quarantined. Evidence limits honoured by not overclaiming; human sugar withdrawal never claimed as diagnosis; animal work never sold as human proof.

Fork 4 — Villain: Two villains, both hit hard. The engineered trap — sugar industry, bliss-point formulation, advertising and ubiquity that manufactured desire — and the named anti-method — the Willpower Method and its diet-restriction kin — that kept the reader in it. Warm to the person, vicious to the trap and the wrong method. Never contempt for the reader.

Fork 5 — Void: Change nothing else in life. Natural baseline returns on its own. Body, hunger, satisfaction, instinct and real food are the positive authority, met as concrete encounters in the first third. No replacement system, no void-filling programme, no trigger-avoidance as strategy.

Redefinition and margin-for-error doctrine: BAD SUGAR means refined sugar plus added free sugars plus junk processed carbs and starchy snack-carbs eaten as sweet hits, including sugary drinks, confectionery, biscuits, cakes, desserts, sweetened cereals and equivalent grazing doses. Definition boxed in CH-01 and decreed: when this book says sugar, take it to mean BAD SUGAR. Natural sugars inside whole fruit, vegetables and plain meals are not the target and belong to the positive authority menu. Full total-abstinence trap logic runs inside the line: there is no healthy level other than zero sought. Margin: the body can cope with an occasional accidental blip, but the mind cannot afford a deliberate one; a slip revives nothing unless the Sweet Con belief is let back in. Seatbelt logic. Guard the belief, not the behaviour with panic.

Clinical / eating-disorder safety perimeter: Plan-wide advisory CA-SAFE defined once in §5. Routed on safety cards and in ledger safety limits. Never fused into instruction wording. No diabetes management, no medical nutrition therapy, no eating-disorder treatment, no weight-loss mechanics. Crisis-pointer territory, not method territory. Method advice never overrides clinician advice; any reader with diabetes, on glucose-affecting medication, pregnant, with history of eating disorder, or with medical risk talks to their clinician and uses this book for belief change only.

Strongest pro-behavior scene: The deserved celebration — late afternoon or evening, cinema or sofa or birthday table, the chocolate / dessert presented as love, reward and the point of the occasion. Saved for CH-09 and reassigned drop by drop.

Destination state: Whenever sweet craving or sweet memory crosses the mind, the reader feels relief and freedom that they no longer feed the Sugar Trap — happy to be free, pitying trapped users, never reopening the decision, inhabiting mornings, shops and meals with ease.

Fresh ending reframe (saved for CH-13 only): You have not given up sweetness; sweetness was stolen from you by the Trap and has now been handed back — this was never about quitting, it was about growing back into the eater you were.

Method preserved: escape not sacrifice; warm to the person / vicious to the trap; no willpower as solution; fear raised at full force then disowned by the escape wherever assigned; immediate freedom after belief change; autonomy of self-discovery inside a commanded frame; original prose; Fork-1 line per style guide.

## 2. COMPACT EVIDENCE LEDGER

Each row is single-unit unless noted. Writer may use only IDs cited on their card, within stated limits.

EV-01 — Lived fuel misread.
Finding: Mid-afternoon dip answered with a sweet top-up believed to be functioning.
Reader line: "I would have something quick and sweet but now know that will only give a short term lift which will inevitably be followed by a fast drop."
Research unit: LEU-001. Source: bank-02 B-003. Grade: lived account.
Scope: afternoon yo-yo routine, recovered-writer description.
Permitted inference: the lift–crash cycle is self-described by recovered writers; the fuel misreads a spike-then-drop as genuine energy.
Prohibited inference: that every reader has clinically low blood sugar, or that sugar is ever real fuel.
Empirical limit: lived description, not glucose measurement.
Safety limit: no medical diagnosis from this quote; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-02 — Lived one-bite-becomes-box.
Finding: A permitted sliver triggers an unstoppable binge; loss of control as trap signature.
Reader line: "I just crave sweets and when i eat them, i feel like i cant stop."
Research unit: LEU-002. Source: bank-02 BM-3. Grade: lived account.
Scope: evening at home, moderation-rule collapse.
Permitted inference: the craving, once triggered, carries the binge; the loss-of-control is the trap's signature.
Prohibited inference: that sugar condemns anyone to helplessness permanently.
Empirical limit: lived description of triggered binge.
Safety limit: no pathological labeling of the reader; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-03 — Lived deserved reward.
Finding: Sweet as self-payment for stress, virtue or celebration.
Reader line: "celebrating, rewarding myself, going to the cinema, etc with chocolate."
Research unit: LEU-003. Source: bank-09 LX-158. Grade: lived account.
Scope: celebration / cinema / after-hard-day reward moment.
Permitted inference: dessert as self-payment for virtue is a community-named frame; the reward-frame keeps the loop alive.
Prohibited inference: that no one may ever enjoy sweet food.
Empirical limit: lived frame, not proof of universal motive.
Safety limit: do not moralize sweetness as universally forbidden.

EV-04 — Intermittent-binge model.
Finding: Intermittent sugar access produces bingeing, craving, withdrawal signs and cross-sensitization with sugar as reinforcer.
Research unit: S-1. Source: S-1. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animals, intermittent 12-h access.
Permitted inference: schedule-plus-sugar can drive binge pattern in this model.
Prohibited inference: that this proves human sugar addiction diagnosis.
Empirical limit: rat model, intermittent 12-h access; translates cautiously to humans.
Safety limit: no human withdrawal diagnosis; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-05 — Dopamine release on binge.
Finding: Each sugar binge releases dopamine in nucleus accumbens, re-triggering reward circuit.
Research unit: S-2. Source: S-2. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animals, microdialysis.
Permitted inference: binge re-fires wanting circuitry in this model.
Prohibited inference: that dopamine equals pleasure or that magnitude equals drugs of abuse.
Empirical limit: animal microdialysis; magnitude smaller than drugs of abuse.
Safety limit: mechanism visibility only; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-06 — Measured dip after sugar.
Finding: After sugar bingeing, low accumbens dopamine with rise in opposing transmitter — real measured dip after the sugar.
Research unit: S-3. Source: S-3. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animals, withdrawal phase.
Permitted inference: the low follows the high in this model; supports rescuer-as-perpetrator shape.
Prohibited inference: that human sugar withdrawal is a diagnosis.
Empirical limit: opiate-like, naloxone-precipitated; human sugar withdrawal not a diagnosis.
Safety limit: do not label reader as in clinical withdrawal; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-07 — Mild but well-defined.
Finding: Overall neurochemical dependency characterized by pro-addiction lab as mild but well-defined.
Research unit: S-4. Source: S-4. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: rat model summary characterisation.
Permitted inference: may defuse fear of quitting without denying a grip; trivial physical part.
Prohibited inference: that quitting requires medical detox or willpower battle.
Empirical limit: rat model; small magnitude; defuses fear without denying a grip.
Safety limit: use to calm, not to frighten; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-08 — Schedule is the trap form.
Finding: Intermittent access drives escalation and binge volume; ad-lib access does not produce dependency signs.
Research unit: S-5. Source: S-5. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animal control-group comparison.
Permitted inference: restriction-binge yo-yo echoes human diet-binge pattern as trap form.
Prohibited inference: that ad-lib BAD SUGAR is safe.
Empirical limit: animal control-group comparison; echoes the human diet-binge yo-yo.
Safety limit: no diet prescription; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-09 — Opioid / cue analogue.
Finding: Sugar loop runs on body's own opioid system and cue/reactivity circuits, analogue for lingering cue-driven craving.
Research unit: S-6. Source: S-6. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: rodents; naloxone-precipitated signs and cue work.
Permitted inference: may name lingering wrapper / smell / time-of-day cue firing before the bite.
Prohibited inference: that cues compel use or that physiology removes choice.
Empirical limit: rodent; no human physiologic withdrawal proven.
Safety limit: cues as learned firing, not compulsion; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-10 — Open scientific question.
Finding: Leading review argues animal bingeing reflects access pattern not sugar neurochemistry and human evidence is thin; sugar-is-addictive is open question.
Research unit: S-11. Source: S-11. Grade: CONTESTED.
Scope: perspective review, cross-species.
Permitted inference: may state honestly that consensus is open while binge behaviours occur under intermittent access.
Prohibited inference: that contest settles that sugar is harmless or that dependence is proven.
Empirical limit: perspective review; both camps grant binge behaviors occur under intermittent access; dopamine is not pleasure, wanting / liking distinction.
Safety limit: use for honesty, not to license continued use; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-11 — Prevalence once.
Finding: Populations meet addiction-like criteria for highly palatable food on validated scales, pooled prevalence about 14% adults / 12% children, comparable to alcohol / tobacco.
Research unit: S-12. Source: S-12. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: population self-report scales.
Permitted inference: reader is not uniquely weak; trap is common.
Prohibited inference: that scale score equals DSM-5 diagnosis.
Empirical limit: self-report; not a DSM-5 diagnosis. Use once only, in CH-08.
Safety limit: normalise without pathologising; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-12 — Mood predicts, not relief.
Finding: Higher sugar intake from sweets linked with higher later odds of common mental disorder in men; daily treat predicts future mood, reverse causation checked and not found.
Research unit: S-15. Source: S-15. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: longitudinal cohort, men for incident disorder.
Permitted inference: daily treat predicts later low mood rather than fixing mood.
Prohibited inference: that sugar causes depression in all readers or that effect is immediate.
Empirical limit: observational; men only for incident CMD.
Safety limit: no mental-health diagnosis or promise; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-13 — Deferred load, not free energy.
Finding: High added-sugar intake linked with higher heart / stroke risk via liver overload, raised blood pressure, chronic inflammation and appetite-control bypass.
Research unit: S-17. Source: S-17. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: institutional summaries, population level.
Permitted inference: lift is deferred load, not free energy.
Prohibited inference: that any single dose causes disease or that teaspoon figures are exact for the reader.
Empirical limit: population-level causal language; teaspoon figures approximate.
Safety limit: population risk, not personal sentence; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-14 — Cavity as bodily stake.
Finding: Free sugars drive plaque acid and decay; clear healthy-diet guidance to limit free sugars.
Research unit: S-20. Source: S-20. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: dental mechanism plus guidance.
Permitted inference: cavity is a real bodily stake of frequent free-sugar doses.
Prohibited inference: that brushing / fluoride are irrelevant.
Empirical limit: caries is mechanism claim; other factors mediate.
Safety limit: state mechanism, not dental advice; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-15 — Crash mechanism with limit.
Finding: Post-meal reactive dip gives mechanism for 3pm crash; lift is insulin working and same surge can produce real after-dip, but everyday slumps are not clinically low glucose.
Research unit: S-21. Source: S-21. Grade: SUPPORTED / MIXED as sealed.
Scope: healthy non-diabetics, post-meal window.
Permitted inference: may explain crash as insulin aftermath for some, within limit.
Prohibited inference: that everyday slump equals clinical hypoglycemia.
Empirical limit: symptoms often without measured low glucose; reactive hypoglycemia in healthy non-diabetics is contested; clinical hypoglycemia is rare.
Safety limit: no glucose diagnosis; anyone with diabetes / medication follows clinician; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-16 — Not essential import.
Finding: Glucose is a nutrient the body manufactures from protein and glycerol; eliminating BAD SUGAR is not deprivation.
Research unit: S-22. Source: S-22. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: basic physiology.
Permitted inference: clean baseline without BAD SUGAR is physiologically coherent.
Prohibited inference: that this prescribes ketogenic diet or any eating plan.
Empirical limit: supports clean-baseline; not a prescription of ketogenic diets.
Safety limit: no diet prescription; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-17 — Days-long hump.
Finding: Highly palatable food withdrawal modeled in animals and scale-measured in humans, symptoms peaking 2–5 days after cutting down then passing.
Research unit: S-23. Source: S-23. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animal model plus preliminary human scales.
Permitted inference: discomfort is time-limited hump, days-long, small-scale, not lifelong fight.
Prohibited inference: that hump is severe, universal or medical withdrawal.
Empirical limit: human evidence preliminary plus retrospective; the hump is days-long, small-scale.
Safety limit: normalise without medicalising; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-18 — Split abstinence experiments.
Finding: Two adolescent sweet-drink abstinence experiments disagree on whether withdrawal improves or worsens symptoms.
Research unit: S-24. Source: S-24. Grade: CONTESTED.
Scope: teens, sweet drinks only, 3-day windows.
Permitted inference: honest line is evidence is split in this narrow window.
Prohibited inference: that either result proves adult BAD SUGAR course.
Empirical limit: teens, SSB only, 3-day windows.
Safety limit: do not generalise to reader course; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-19 — Crowding and cue firing.
Finding: Reward-circuit crowding / blunting named for escalation and needing family size, while cue-driven hyper-reactivity to wrappers / smells fires before the bite.
Research unit: S-26. Source: S-26. Grade: MIXED.
Scope: much imaging in obesity / binge-eating samples.
Permitted inference: may name needing more for same effect and cue firing as learned trap features.
Prohibited inference: that imaging proves compulsion.
Empirical limit: much imaging in obesity / BED; interpretation consistent with, not proven by, imaging.
Safety limit: describe experience, not brain destiny; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-20 — Ceiling exceeded.
Finding: WHO sets below 10% / 50g daily free-sugar ceiling and below 5% additional-benefit target because current consumption far exceeds both.
Research unit: S-16. Source: S-16. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: population recommendation.
Permitted inference: normal intake sits far above guidance; feeling fine does not mean intake is low.
Prohibited inference: that any dose below ceiling is safe or that ceiling is toxicity threshold.
Empirical limit: population-level recommendation; not sugar is toxic at any dose.
Safety limit: guidance context, not personal prescription; honour CA-SAFE.

## 4. SCENE AND ANALOGY BANK

SC-01 — Kitchen-cupboard con. Concrete: adult at 10pm told one biscuit is free choice, cupboard already half-empty, hand moving before decision. Job: confidence-trick without blame; who's-in-charge trap. Constraint: original prose; warm to person, fraud is the Trap; no shaming gluttony.

SC-02 — Child eating from hunger. Concrete: small child eats peach hungrily, stops mid-bite, runs off; no counting, no guilt, body leads. Job: installs body / hunger / satisfaction / real food as encountered authority. Constraint: concrete encounter, not slogan; do not delay authority to late chapter.

SC-03 — 3pm office lift-crash. Concrete: desk at 3pm, sweet top-up, ten-minute buzz, 4pm fog and second reach. Job: inversion demo for fuel claim. Constraint: honour EV-15 limit; never diagnose glucose.

SC-04 — Evening box emptied. Concrete: permitted single biscuit, wrapper rustle, box empty, regret before swallow ends. Job: genie-in-bottle; moderation absurdity seed. Constraint: no pathological label; use EV-02 only.

SC-05 — Cinema celebration sweet. Concrete: lights dim, shared chocolate at funny scene, warmth, laughter, love in the room — sweet in hand.

SC-09 — Prison door ajar and hovering lion. Concrete: cell door open, prisoner begs to stay from fear of outside; freed lion paces by open cage from habit, not need. Job: collapses fear-of-failure and fear-of-success; post-change wobble as cage-habit. Constraint: both ropes belong to Trap; no new fear installed.

SC-10 — Sweet-tea perception test and slow pot. Concrete: reader tastes two identical teas mislabelled treat / healthy and swears one is better; water warming so slowly frog never notices. Job: hands-on proof perception lies; gradual harm why feeling fine misleads. Debut full enactment only in CH-09. Constraint: enactment, not homework label; honour evidence limits.

## 5. LEXICON AND INSTRUCTION SPINE

Lexicon — Trap register (always for behavior): BAD SUGAR, dose, fix, hit, feed the Nibbler, the Sugar Trap, the Sweet Con, brainwashed, conned, trapped, slavery, con, poison in sweet coat where plausible. Units renamed as doses. Community-normal as brainwashing.

Lexicon — Freedom register (always for stopping): escape, free, freedom, marvellous, wonderful, exciting, rejoice, celebrate, relief, brilliant, get on with enjoying your life, happy to be free.

Lexicon — Banned register: give up, resist, stay strong, discipline, abstain, abstinence, sacrifice except naming illusion of sacrifice, trying to stop, one day at a time, day-counting, streaks, recovery journey, quit cold turkey as framing, instead, I can't have X, giving up. Quit as plain verb allowed.

Reader dialect (source-grounded, for ventriloquised inner voice only): the roller coaster; sugary somethings to get me through; treat when you feel you deserve one; I've managed to be good this week; I want to get off the roller coaster; I-need-to-eat-something-RIGHT-NOW feeling; short term lift then fast drop; I feel like i cant stop; celebrating with chocolate.

Justification menu mapped to demolition:
just a treat / once a week is fine — CH-10.
I don't keep it in the house — CH-10.
I need sugar to function / sugary somethings to get me through — CH-05.
It rewards me / I deserve one / celebrating with chocolate — CH-09.
It comforts stress / food is love — CH-09.
It helps concentration / gets me through afternoon — CH-05.
Everyone eats it / it's normal — CH-08.
I'll quit tomorrow / after birthday / after holidays — CH-10.
Fruit is sugar too so nothing matters — CH-01 definition, CH-06 inhabit.

Clinical advisory CA-SAFE — defined once, boxed:
> If you live with diabetes or pre-diabetes, take medication that affects blood sugar or appetite, are pregnant, live with an eating disorder past or present, or have any medical condition where changing what you eat could carry risk, talk to your clinician before changing anything and follow their advice first. This book changes a belief about BAD SUGAR; it does not give medical, diabetes, or eating-disorder care. If you ever feel faint, ill, or distressed around food, seek care promptly and put this book aside until you are cleared to continue.

Instruction spine — frozen spoken imperatives only. Headline plus at most one rationale line. Owning chapter shown. All recapped verbatim without chapter callbacks in CH-13 final list. No mid-book recap.

Final photographable recap (CH-13, no callbacks): the twelve imperatives above in order, bare headlines with their single rationale lines, closing with M-I.

## 6. ARC AND LENGTH

Concept debuts: BAD SUGAR line + entry promise + triad + ease clause + eat contract in CH-01. Trap + both creatures in passing + sensory phrase in CH-02. TO/FOR + illusion phrase + stakes phrase in CH-03. Willpower Method named CH-04. Fuel inversion + cost formula CH-05. Inhabit authority CH-06. Mechanism split argued CH-07. Manufacture + fear + identity + prevalence once CH-08. Strongest scene + perception enactment + myths + testimony CH-09. Totality CH-10. Vow + terminal mantra CH-11. Ordinary speech + no-reopen CH-12. Recap + saved growing reframe CH-13.

Demolition curve: low in first third, rising CH-04 to CH-05, peak CH-07 to CH-10, handing to freedom after vow.
Freedom crescendo: promise in CH-01, deliberately suppressed through middle demolitions, detonated in final quarter CH-11 to CH-13; last fifth holds more freedom language than rest combined.
Promise front-load: easy-register clustered at entry, then assumed.
Command frame: reading instructions open, freedom instructions close, both recapped verbatim at very end.
Saved reframe: growing-back reveal appears only in CH-13.

Structural responsibilities: redefinition box CH-01. Long testimony in main flow in own room CH-09. Myths Q&A distinct room CH-09. Meta-inoculation answering method-objection CH-09 into CH-10.

Chapter 12
FREE MORNINGS AND EASY EVENINGS

**IN THIS CHAPTER** — The bright morning kitchen and kettle, the noon aisle and humming chillers, the till with open packets, the plain favourite meal on a normal plate, the evening sofa with hot tea, the birthday table glimpsed in passing

*Ordinary life without BAD SUGAR is not vigilance — it is ease you live once the decision stays shut.*

### THE MORNING AFTER THE VOW

Wake up free.

No count starts. No test starts. No grey waiting starts. The vow closed the question last night and morning opens clean. Make tea. Open the curtains. Feel the mouth clear and the head clear. That lightness you felt at the table was not excitement playing tricks. It is what clear feels like when hunt leaves it.

You will look for the old morning hunt from habit. We all looked. We opened the cupboard door and stared for a second longer than shopping needed. We felt the hand remember the packet before the mind remembered freedom. Smile at that second. It is memory, not need. It is an echo walking past an open door, not a chain pulling you back.

Eat breakfast because you are hungry. Real hunger has a plain voice. It says eat, and then it says enough. Have bread, porridge, eggs, fruit, yoghurt — what you like from true food, eaten with appetite, stopped at satisfaction. Notice how the meal closes itself. Bite, savour, ease, done. No rustle calling from the side. No second reach to finish what the first opened. No fog an hour later asking for repair.

I tell you as one who lived the roller coaster for years. My first free morning surprised me with its plainness. No trumpets. Kettle, toast, cold air at the window. And plainness was the marvel. The morning did not need a lift to start it. The body started it. Hunger called, food answered, satisfaction closed the door. Getting on with enjoying your life looks exactly like that, and it feels marvellous because nothing pulls at your sleeve while you live it.

You change nothing else. Same kitchen. Same chair. Same walk to work. Same people. Freedom does not ask for a new life built around absence. It hands your old life back without the hunt inside it. That is why this is escape, not loss. What left was the hunt. What stayed is everything you loved, tasted more cleanly.

Ask the morning plainly.

Did the old sweet breakfast ever give the day a start? Or did it give a flare and a coat and a mid-morning dip that needed another flare? Did true food ever leave you pacing? You know the answer from your own mouth, not from my preaching. True hunger met with true food frees attention for the day. A hit chains attention to the next hit. Which morning do you stand in now?

You stand in the free one. Rejoice in it.

### THE SHOP AT NOON

Walk into the shop at noon as a free eater.

The aisle hums. Bright packets stand shoulder to shoulder. Cartoon tigers grin. Large family packs promise value. The till flashes small bars at child height. The smell of warm bakery rolls out and wraps round your legs. We walked this aisle for years with quick hands and a quick pulse, telling ourselves we chose freely while the hand moved before decision.

Walk it now with clear eyes.

Look at the packets without hurry. See them for what they are. Loud coats around a flare and a prod. Bliss-point doses built to open the low they pretend to close, sold by men who never eat their own advertising for breakfast. I feel anger for the makers who papered your childhood with mascots, and warmth for you who once believed the paper. You were conned, never weak. Seeing the con ends the want without a fight.

You will feel a prod at the till. A gleam, a smell, a time-of-day echo that says sweet now. Do not push the thought away. You cannot not think of sweetness in a world papered with packets, and you never need to try. Let the picture float up and let joy answer it at once.

Think, bright and certain:

BRILLIANT! I'M FREE!

Mean it. Feel the lift in the chest where dread sat. At first you will say it on purpose, almost surprised at your own grin. Then it comes faster. Then it comes on its own. A packet glimpsed becomes pity for trapped hands and relief you no longer hunt. A smell becomes proof the tiny echo is dying and you are living. That sentence guards the mind without strain. It turns an intruder into a reminder of freedom.

Buy what you came to buy. True food, enough for hunger, chosen with pleasure. Read no small print with fear. Take no brave detour round the confectionery aisle for the rest of time. A free eater needs no detour. Walk past the bright wall the way you walk past shoes that are not your size — no pang, no lecture, no debate. The door on BAD SUGAR stays shut, and every other door stays wide.

If you live with diabetes or take medicine that changes blood sugar or appetite, are pregnant, or carry any eating-disorder history, speak to your clinician first and follow their advice while you use this book for belief only.

That boundary honours the body while the mind stays free. For everyone, the rule of the shop is simple. You do not need to be clever here. You need to hold the seeing you already own. No sweet stays special. The decision stays shut. The hands stay calm.

### THE MEAL THAT CLOSES ITSELF

Come home hungry and eat.

Hunger is your friend returned. We feared hunger for years because the trap taught us to read every hollow prod as an order for a hit. True hunger is different. It builds slowly, it welcomes plain food, it closes with satisfaction and hands attention back to life. Learn its voice again over one normal plate and you will never need another teacher.

Cook simply or buy simply. Market vegetables, fresh bread, soup, meat or beans, rice, cheese, fruit — your favourite from real food, not a plan from a book. Sit down. Taste the first bite with full attention. Feel savour rise and then settle. Stop when satisfied leaves you light. That close is the body's signature. No counting taught it. No will taught it.

Watch the little child who leaves half a peach and runs off to play, and you watch your own nature before brainwashing covered it.

No guilt in that leaving. No rule in that stopping. The body led and joy followed. You eat the same way now. Not because you obey. Because hunt no longer talks over hunger.

We ate for years with noise on top of hunger — flare, coat, prod, hunt — and called the noise appetite. It was the Sugar Trap feeding its loop through our hands. It made meals grey and then sold the grey back to us as proof we needed a sweet close. The fact is plain now. Meals were never grey. The low after the dose dimmed them. Clear the dose and colour returns on its own. Food tastes more, not less. Satisfaction lasts longer, not shorter. Evenings feel fuller, not emptier.

Ask at the table while the plate empties.

Does this meal need a sweet finish to complete it? Or did the old sweet finish un-complete true meals, coating the mouth, waking hunt, stealing satisfaction and calling it pleasure? If the finish truly completed joy, why did years of finishes leave you flat, foggy, hunting? There is only one honest reading. The finish broke the close. The close was already here — hunger met, pleasure taken, enough reached.

Stay with that enough. It is marvellous to feel. It is wonderful to trust. It asks nothing from you tomorrow. It promises nothing it will not keep tonight. It is yours.

Drink water. Clear the mouth. Leave the table light. Get on with your evening, happy to be free.

### WHEN HANDS AROUND YOU HOLD OUT PACKETS

They will.

Workmates with a tin. Friends with cake. Family with love on a plate. A birthday table bright with candles. Dimmed lights with laughter in the room and chocolate passing hand to hand. We all meet that moment in the first free days and feel the old pull to join so we do not seem harsh or strange.

Feel pity, never envy.

Look with clear eyes at hands still hunting. Quick fingers. Half attention on faces, half on packets. Coated mouth between laughs. Thought of the next while chewing this one. Does that look like enjoyment? Does that look like love? The scene holds the warmth — the faces, the laughter, the pause — and the dose only ever sneaked a ride on that warmth. You know because you replayed the scene without the dose and sweetness stayed where it belonged, in company and leisure, not in powder.

You are not deprived while they indulge. They are hunted while you are free. Who should pity whom? Who should envy whom? Let the answer arrive as relief, not pride. We were those hands last month. We know the fog behind the grin. We left through seeing, not through strength, and seeing can reach them only through our ease, never through our preaching.

So say a warm no thank you and leave it there. Take tea, take fruit, take nothing, laugh fully. Do not explain the trap unless asked plainly, and then speak briefly and kindly and turn back to the evening. Do not argue aunties, offices, or old friends back into doubt. Let visible ease do the recruiting. Preaching breeds defence in them and reopens debate in you, and debate is the one soil where a dead idea can look alive again.

I stood at a family table three days free with cake circling and felt the old voice offer politeness as a reason. I smiled, kept my hands clear, ate my meal hungry, laughed till my sides ached, and walked home light. No loss sat in the car with me. Relief did. The evening had given everything without a single hit. That memory now guards me better than any rule could.

If they tease, let them tease. “Go on, one won’t hurt.” “You were always good for a biscuit.” Hear those lines for what they are — trap scripts spoken by kind mouths who still believe them. One never stayed one in our own box. One woke the hunt and lit the low and taught the mind that sweetness helps again. You do not need to prove control by testing. Control was never the point. Seeing is the point, and seeing stays shut.

Celebrate their company. Pity their hunt. Rejoice in your freedom. Then get on with enjoying your life while the packet circles without you.

### WHEN THE THOUGHT FLOATS UP IN THE QUIET

Evenings will bring a quiet prod.

Sofa, tea, ламп light low, day done. The body sighs and the mind pictures gleam. Time-of-day memory fires before hunger speaks. Smell memory fires before need speaks. We all know that nine o’clock picture — wrapper gleam, hand to mouth, brief flare while the programme plays on unwatched.

Meet it with joy, not with debate.

You cannot suppress a thought by ordering it away. Push at it and it grows. Argue with it and you keep it alive as an open question. The free way is shorter. Let the picture come and let the answer come faster, bright and certain:

BRILLIANT! I'M FREE!

That is not a chant to drown craving. It is the truth spoken at the moment the lie knocks. The thought is a dead echo, not an order. The Nibbler grumbles faintly because no hand feeds it, and its grumble is good news. A dying grumble proves starving, not danger. Smile at it. It thins in days to nothing worth naming, and each time it fires your relief it loses a little more of its voice.

Ask the sofa thought till it confesses.

If the dose truly rested evenings, why did years of rested evenings leave you more tired? If the dose truly soothed, why did the mind race more after the packet emptied? If you truly loved those nights, why did you half-watch the faces you love while counting crumbs? There is only one answer that honours your life. The dose broke rest and called the break relief. Rest was the chair, the breath, the warmth, the story. The dose stole attention from rest and sold it back as rest.

Feel rest return now. Tea hot in clean mouth. Body heavy in a good way. Attention whole. Programme watched or book read or nothing done at all — all sweet without powder because sweetness was never powder. It was ease, and ease returns the moment hunt leaves.

Do not mourn those old sofa packets as lost friends. Mourn nothing. They were not friends. They were a small loop with a loud voice, already dying the moment belief died. Rejoice at a dead enemy. That joy is the guard that never tires, the lock that never rusts.

### IF A CRUMB SLIPS IN

Hear this kindly before life tests it, so a slip never becomes a fall.

Your body can meet an accidental crumb without alarm. Sauce with hidden sugar at a friend’s table. A bite taken before you read a label. A mouthful offered and tasted before the mind caught up. Note it as a rumble strip under the wheel, learn to look clearer next time, keep the wheel straight with joy. A rumble warns. It does not crash the car.

Only a deliberate packet believed in can trap, because only belief feeds the loop again. A crumb swallowed by accident revives nothing unless you let the old idea back in with it — the idea that one was good, that you blew it now so you may as well hunt, that the grumble proves need. Those ideas are scripts, not reasoning. They arrive pre-labelled. Smile at the label and drive on free.

We all feared we would blow freedom with one mistake. I feared it through my first dinner out, watching sauces and breads like a guard. Then a dressing caught me, sweet on the tongue, and panic knocked. I saw the panic for what it was — the old method talking, the one that counted streaks and turned a crumb into a verdict. This method counts nothing. It guards seeing. Seeing stayed shut, so the crumb passed like weather and freedom stayed like daylight.

Never use a slip as permission for a second. “Got away with it, so one more won’t hurt” is the trap asking for its feed through relief. The seat of freedom is the mind, not the mouth. Guard the mind and the mouth follows. Steer back to hunger, satisfaction, and real food enjoyed as favourite, and the wheel holds true.

Be stern with the lie here and warm with yourself always. You are not fragile. You are not one crumb from ruin. You are a clear eater whose belief stays closed. Hold that. The Nibbler starves while you live brightly, and the Sugar Trap keeps no power over a mind that will not reopen the question.

### 13. NEVER REOPEN THE DECISION
A passing thought is a dead enemy, not an order.

Speak that line whenever the mind tries to debate. Do not weigh Fridays. Do not weigh just one. Do not weigh tomorrow. Weighing is the trap asking to live as a question. Freedom lives as an answer. You answered with clear eyes at an ordinary table. Let the answer stand.

You are free now, wonderful to feel, exciting to walk with into ordinary days. Rejoice. Celebrate. Get on with enjoying your life.

**SUMMARY**
- Mornings start clear and bright when hunger calls and true food answers without a hunt pulling at the sleeve.
- Shops lose their pull once packets are seen as loud coats around a flare and a prod, and pity replaces envy at the till.
- Real meals close themselves with satisfaction and hand attention back to life, with no sweet finish needed to complete joy.
- Company and laughter hold the warmth at every table, and a warm no thank you keeps hands clear without preaching.
- A passing sweet picture means instant celebration of freedom, and a faint grumble means the loop is starving, not calling.
- An accidental crumb teaches clearer looking and changes nothing, while a deliberate exception believed in is the only door that could trap.
