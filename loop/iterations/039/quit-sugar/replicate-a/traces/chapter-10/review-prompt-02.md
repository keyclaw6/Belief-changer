You are the book factory chapter-reviewer, a fresh isolated role call.

Follow this contract exactly:

# Chapter reviewer

You are a factory component, not a judge. You never see a reference book
or any judge prompt. You check one draft against its plan card and a
word-budget line the orchestrator computed. Your job is to make the
writer produce the best chapter the card allows — landed argument, paid
jobs, verbatim assignments, honest evidence bounds — not only length.

## Inputs (exactly these)

1. The accepted master plan
2. This chapter's card
3. The draft chapter
4. One line: `Delivered N words. Budget B.`

## Output

Start with exactly `ACCEPT` or `REVISE`.

Then at most 7 findings. Each finding is one of:

- `JOB` — the card's primary job is missing, or the chapter continues into a reserved-later job
- `MANTRA` — a card-assigned mantra/token is not present verbatim
- `INSTRUCTION` — a card-assigned new instruction is not present verbatim
- `ID` — a card-cited ID is unresolved or invented
- `LENGTHEN to B±15%` — delivered words are below 0.85 × B
- `SHORTEN to B±15%` — delivered words are above 1.15 × B
- `HEADER` — the draft opens with the workshop header `IN THIS CHAPTER`, or presents a plan-inventory entry instead of an earned spoken command. For each numbered instruction outside the final photographable recap, check that this card assigns it as NEW and that the immediately preceding argument makes its particular imperative the reader's warranted next conclusion; a generic rationale line does not establish either condition. Quote the header and the passage that should earn it. If it is an assigned echo rather than a new instruction, require the frozen words to remain verbatim as a brief spoken sentence in the current context, without an inventory number or a new-instruction announcement. If it is a new instruction, preserve its number and exact imperative, but replace the generic lead-in or rationale with the concrete connection to the argument already made; do not rebuild an earlier proof or announce the instruction's ordinal in words. A numbered command that meets these conditions, and the final photographable instruction recap, are not HEADER.
- `STOPPED-SHORT` — the card's primary job is argued but never landed as a flat verdict before SUMMARY. The reader can still hold the entering belief. Quote the missing landing.
- `UNASSIGNED-REFRAIN` — a non-mantra phrase recurs ≥3× verbatim. Name the phrase and the count. Subtract repeats; do not invent a new mantra.
- `RESERVED-REACH` — the draft performs a later chapter's primary job. Name that later card and cut the overreach to at most one sentence.
- `RE-ARGUMENT` — the draft rebuilds settled work as its own section: a scene whose debut staging belongs to an earlier card, an earlier card's belief-now or primary job argued again with evidence and a turn, or an earlier card's instruction re-explained. Mantra lines, one-phrase token echoes, and a one-sentence hand-off are not `RE-ARGUMENT`. Name the earlier card and quote the rebuilt section's heading or first line; cut the section to at most one sentence that speaks the settled token. If that cut leaves the chapter below 0.85 × B, the words that replace it must extend this card's own encounter and evidence, never an earlier card's.
- `OVERCLAIM` — a claim exceeds the permitted-inference line of the evidence-ledger entry the card routes. Quote the overclaim and the bound. The writer must speak the bound; never print the ledger ID or grade in prose.

No other finding types. No style notes. No "sounds like AI." No comparison
to any other book. No warmth, tone, or voice coaching.

`ACCEPT` only when every check above is fine (length inside ±15% of B, job
done and stopped and landed, assigned mantras/instructions verbatim, IDs
resolved, no `HEADER`, no unassigned refrain, no reserved-later job, no
re-argument, no overclaim).

`REVISE` when any check fails. List the findings. Be specific: quote the
missing job, the missing wording, or the overclaim.

## Rules

- Do not rewrite the chapter yourself.
- Do not invent a word budget. Use B from the orchestrator line.
- Do not ask for another review round. The orchestrator decides whether
  there is another rewrite (up to three).
- When you demand more words, make the LENGTHEN finding an expansion assignment, not merely a quotation of the card's job: identify a specific unfinished encounter, unanswered objection, or undeveloped consequence belonging to this card, quote the draft location to extend, and state what new understanding or lived consequence that extension must deliver. Check that target against earlier cards and against conclusions already landed in this draft; neither an earlier proof in a new setting nor another proof of the same landed conclusion is a valid expansion target. For an ordinary-life card, extend what happens next with the settled understanding already assumed, not how that understanding is proved again. If you cannot identify an unspent target supported by the card and plan, report that limitation within LENGTHEN rather than inventing evidence or requesting generic additional examples; retain the computed budget and the existing ACCEPT requirements.
- Your entire reply IS the review.

Delivered 3964 words. Budget 4400.

# Master Plan — Quit Sugar
`production-books/quit-sugar/master-plan.md`

## 1. BOOK CORE

Target behavior: Compulsive consumption of refined / added sugar and junk carbs — the craving-snacking loop, the lift-crash-repeat, the evening binge and daily grazing, not nutrition pedantry.

Reader (planner-facing state): An adult who feels quietly trapped in the sweet loop, has tried diets, moderation rules and white-knuckle weeks and watched each collapse, suspects the whole approach is wrong, and still believes life would be greyer without sweet treats. No proper-name handle. No pupil-persona.

Load-bearing false belief: Bad sugar is a genuine treat or fuel that makes life sweeter and more bearable, and life without it would be deprivation.

Through-line: Bad sugar gives nothing; the Sugar Trap creates the emptiness, fatigue and need it pretends to solve; see the con, starve the tiny physical echo, and eating returns to hunger, satisfaction and real food enjoyed as favourite — escape, not sacrifice.

Format: Full-length Carr book, 13 chapters, 60,000 words planned. Front matter authority dossier assumed. Back-matter appendix quarantines raw citations. One ordinary-life chapter after the vow, then short photographable recap.

Fork 1 — Inner monster: Full Carr personification, default. Little creature to starve: THE NIBBLER, called the Nibbler. Belief-system that feeds it: THE SWEET CON, called the Sweet Con. Craving is external, small, already dying; its grumbles are death throes to rejoice at, never a mighty enemy demanding willpower.

Fork 2 — Outcome: Total cessation inside a redrawn line, commanded with cheerful certainty. BAD SUGAR is the quit target. Moderation foreclosed with pincer and cliff image. No autonomy-to-moderate close; close is commanded vow and instant congratulation.

Fork 3 — Science weight: Hard facts at full Carr force, flat and frightening where true, then relief that change is not from fear. Facts arrive as settled fact, never literature review. Raw citations quarantined. Evidence limits honoured by not overclaiming; human sugar withdrawal never claimed as diagnosis; animal work never sold as human proof.

Fork 4 — Villain: Two villains, both hit hard. The engineered trap — sugar industry, bliss-point formulation, advertising and ubiquity that manufactured desire — and the named anti-method — the Willpower Method and its diet-restriction kin — that kept the reader in it. Warm to the person, vicious to the trap and the wrong method. Never contempt for the reader.

Fork 5 — Void: Change nothing else in life. Natural baseline returns on its own. Body, hunger, satisfaction, instinct and real food are the positive authority, met as concrete encounters in the first third. No replacement system, no void-filling programme, no trigger-avoidance as strategy.

Redefinition and margin-for-error doctrine: BAD SUGAR means refined sugar plus added free sugars plus junk processed carbs and starchy snack-carbs eaten as sweet hits, including sugary drinks, confectionery, biscuits, cakes, desserts, sweetened cereals and equivalent grazing doses. Definition boxed in CH-01 and decreed: when this book says sugar, take it to mean BAD SUGAR. Natural sugars inside whole fruit, vegetables and plain meals are not the target and belong to the positive authority menu. Full total-abstinence trap logic runs inside the line: there is no healthy level other than zero sought. Margin: the body can cope with an occasional accidental blip, but the mind cannot afford a deliberate one; a slip revives nothing unless the Sweet Con belief is let back in. Seatbelt logic. Guard the belief, not the behaviour with panic.

Clinical / eating-disorder safety perimeter: Plan-wide advisory CA-SAFE defined once in §5. Routed on safety cards and in ledger safety limits. Never fused into instruction wording. No diabetes management, no medical nutrition therapy, no eating-disorder treatment, no weight-loss mechanics. Crisis-pointer territory, not method territory. Method advice never overrides clinician advice; any reader with diabetes, on glucose-affecting medication, pregnant, with history of eating disorder, or with medical risk talks to their clinician and uses this book for belief change only.

Strongest pro-behavior scene: The deserved celebration — late afternoon or evening, cinema or sofa or birthday table, the chocolate / dessert presented as love, reward and the point of the occasion. Saved for CH-09 and reassigned drop by drop.

Destination state: Whenever sweet craving or sweet memory crosses the mind, the reader feels relief and freedom that they no longer feed the Sugar Trap — happy to be free, pitying trapped users, never reopening the decision, inhabiting mornings, shops and meals with ease.

Fresh ending reframe (saved for CH-13 only): You have not given up sweetness; sweetness was stolen from you by the Trap and has now been handed back — this was never about quitting, it was about growing back into the eater you were.

Method preserved: escape not sacrifice; warm to the person / vicious to the trap; no willpower as solution; fear raised at full force then disowned by the escape wherever assigned; immediate freedom after belief change; autonomy of self-discovery inside a commanded frame; original prose; Fork-1 line per style guide.

## 2. COMPACT EVIDENCE LEDGER

Each row is single-unit unless noted. Writer may use only IDs cited on their card, within stated limits.

EV-01 — Lived fuel misread.
Finding: Mid-afternoon dip answered with a sweet top-up believed to be functioning.
Reader line: "I would have something quick and sweet but now know that will only give a short term lift which will inevitably be followed by a fast drop."
Research unit: LEU-001. Source: bank-02 B-003. Grade: lived account.
Scope: afternoon yo-yo routine, recovered-writer description.
Permitted inference: the lift–crash cycle is self-described by recovered writers; the fuel misreads a spike-then-drop as genuine energy.
Prohibited inference: that every reader has clinically low blood sugar, or that sugar is ever real fuel.
Empirical limit: lived description, not glucose measurement.
Safety limit: no medical diagnosis from this quote; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-02 — Lived one-bite-becomes-box.
Finding: A permitted sliver triggers an unstoppable binge; loss of control as trap signature.
Reader line: "I just crave sweets and when i eat them, i feel like i cant stop."
Research unit: LEU-002. Source: bank-02 BM-3. Grade: lived account.
Scope: evening at home, moderation-rule collapse.
Permitted inference: the craving, once triggered, carries the binge; the loss-of-control is the trap's signature.
Prohibited inference: that sugar condemns anyone to helplessness permanently.
Empirical limit: lived description of triggered binge.
Safety limit: no pathological labeling of the reader; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-03 — Lived deserved reward.
Finding: Sweet as self-payment for stress, virtue or celebration.
Reader line: "celebrating, rewarding myself, going to the cinema, etc with chocolate."
Research unit: LEU-003. Source: bank-09 LX-158. Grade: lived account.
Scope: celebration / cinema / after-hard-day reward moment.
Permitted inference: dessert as self-payment for virtue is a community-named frame; the reward-frame keeps the loop alive.
Prohibited inference: that no one may ever enjoy sweet food.
Empirical limit: lived frame, not proof of universal motive.
Safety limit: do not moralize sweetness as universally forbidden.

EV-04 — Intermittent-binge model.
Finding: Intermittent sugar access produces bingeing, craving, withdrawal signs and cross-sensitization with sugar as reinforcer.
Research unit: S-1. Source: S-1. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animals, intermittent 12-h access.
Permitted inference: schedule-plus-sugar can drive binge pattern in this model.
Prohibited inference: that this proves human sugar addiction diagnosis.
Empirical limit: rat model, intermittent 12-h access; translates cautiously to humans.
Safety limit: no human withdrawal diagnosis; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-05 — Dopamine release on binge.
Finding: Each sugar binge releases dopamine in nucleus accumbens, re-triggering reward circuit.
Research unit: S-2. Source: S-2. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animals, microdialysis.
Permitted inference: binge re-fires wanting circuitry in this model.
Prohibited inference: that dopamine equals pleasure or that magnitude equals drugs of abuse.
Empirical limit: animal microdialysis; magnitude smaller than drugs of abuse.
Safety limit: mechanism visibility only; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-06 — Measured dip after sugar.
Finding: After sugar bingeing, low accumbens dopamine with rise in opposing transmitter — real measured dip after the sugar.
Research unit: S-3. Source: S-3. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animals, withdrawal phase.
Permitted inference: the low follows the high in this model; supports rescuer-as-perpetrator shape.
Prohibited inference: that human sugar withdrawal is a diagnosis.
Empirical limit: opiate-like, naloxone-precipitated; human sugar withdrawal not a diagnosis.
Safety limit: do not label reader as in clinical withdrawal; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-07 — Mild but well-defined.
Finding: Overall neurochemical dependency characterized by pro-addiction lab as mild but well-defined.
Research unit: S-4. Source: S-4. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: rat model summary characterisation.
Permitted inference: may defuse fear of quitting without denying a grip; trivial physical part.
Prohibited inference: that quitting requires medical detox or willpower battle.
Empirical limit: rat model; small magnitude; defuses fear without denying a grip.
Safety limit: use to calm, not to frighten; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-08 — Schedule is the trap form.
Finding: Intermittent access drives escalation and binge volume; ad-lib access does not produce dependency signs.
Research unit: S-5. Source: S-5. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animal control-group comparison.
Permitted inference: restriction-binge yo-yo echoes human diet-binge pattern as trap form.
Prohibited inference: that ad-lib BAD SUGAR is safe.
Empirical limit: animal control-group comparison; echoes the human diet-binge yo-yo.
Safety limit: no diet prescription; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-09 — Opioid / cue analogue.
Finding: Sugar loop runs on body's own opioid system and cue/reactivity circuits, analogue for lingering cue-driven craving.
Research unit: S-6. Source: S-6. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: rodents; naloxone-precipitated signs and cue work.
Permitted inference: may name lingering wrapper / smell / time-of-day cue firing before the bite.
Prohibited inference: that cues compel use or that physiology removes choice.
Empirical limit: rodent; no human physiologic withdrawal proven.
Safety limit: cues as learned firing, not compulsion; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-10 — Open scientific question.
Finding: Leading review argues animal bingeing reflects access pattern not sugar neurochemistry and human evidence is thin; sugar-is-addictive is open question.
Research unit: S-11. Source: S-11. Grade: CONTESTED.
Scope: perspective review, cross-species.
Permitted inference: may state honestly that consensus is open while binge behaviours occur under intermittent access.
Prohibited inference: that contest settles that sugar is harmless or that dependence is proven.
Empirical limit: perspective review; both camps grant binge behaviors occur under intermittent access; dopamine is not pleasure, wanting / liking distinction.
Safety limit: use for honesty, not to license continued use; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-11 — Prevalence once.
Finding: Populations meet addiction-like criteria for highly palatable food on validated scales, pooled prevalence about 14% adults / 12% children, comparable to alcohol / tobacco.
Research unit: S-12. Source: S-12. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: population self-report scales.
Permitted inference: reader is not uniquely weak; trap is common.
Prohibited inference: that scale score equals DSM-5 diagnosis.
Empirical limit: self-report; not a DSM-5 diagnosis. Use once only, in CH-08.
Safety limit: normalise without pathologising; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-12 — Mood predicts, not relief.
Finding: Higher sugar intake from sweets linked with higher later odds of common mental disorder in men; daily treat predicts future mood, reverse causation checked and not found.
Research unit: S-15. Source: S-15. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: longitudinal cohort, men for incident disorder.
Permitted inference: daily treat predicts later low mood rather than fixing mood.
Prohibited inference: that sugar causes depression in all readers or that effect is immediate.
Empirical limit: observational; men only for incident CMD.
Safety limit: no mental-health diagnosis or promise; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-13 — Deferred load, not free energy.
Finding: High added-sugar intake linked with higher heart / stroke risk via liver overload, raised blood pressure, chronic inflammation and appetite-control bypass.
Research unit: S-17. Source: S-17. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: institutional summaries, population level.
Permitted inference: lift is deferred load, not free energy.
Prohibited inference: that any single dose causes disease or that teaspoon figures are exact for the reader.
Empirical limit: population-level causal language; teaspoon figures approximate.
Safety limit: population risk, not personal sentence; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-14 — Cavity as bodily stake.
Finding: Free sugars drive plaque acid and decay; clear healthy-diet guidance to limit free sugars.
Research unit: S-20. Source: S-20. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: dental mechanism plus guidance.
Permitted inference: cavity is a real bodily stake of frequent free-sugar doses.
Prohibited inference: that brushing / fluoride are irrelevant.
Empirical limit: caries is mechanism claim; other factors mediate.
Safety limit: state mechanism, not dental advice; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-15 — Crash mechanism with limit.
Finding: Post-meal reactive dip gives mechanism for 3pm crash; lift is insulin working and same surge can produce real after-dip, but everyday slumps are not clinically low glucose.
Research unit: S-21. Source: S-21. Grade: SUPPORTED / MIXED as sealed.
Scope: healthy non-diabetics, post-meal window.
Permitted inference: may explain crash as insulin aftermath for some, within limit.
Prohibited inference: that everyday slump equals clinical hypoglycemia.
Empirical limit: symptoms often without measured low glucose; reactive hypoglycemia in healthy non-diabetics is contested; clinical hypoglycemia is rare.
Safety limit: no glucose diagnosis; anyone with diabetes / medication follows clinician; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-16 — Not essential import.
Finding: Glucose is a nutrient the body manufactures from protein and glycerol; eliminating BAD SUGAR is not deprivation.
Research unit: S-22. Source: S-22. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: basic physiology.
Permitted inference: clean baseline without BAD SUGAR is physiologically coherent.
Prohibited inference: that this prescribes ketogenic diet or any eating plan.
Empirical limit: supports clean-baseline; not a prescription of ketogenic diets.
Safety limit: no diet prescription; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-17 — Days-long hump.
Finding: Highly palatable food withdrawal modeled in animals and scale-measured in humans, symptoms peaking 2–5 days after cutting down then passing.
Research unit: S-23. Source: S-23. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: animal model plus preliminary human scales.
Permitted inference: discomfort is time-limited hump, days-long, small-scale, not lifelong fight.
Prohibited inference: that hump is severe, universal or medical withdrawal.
Empirical limit: human evidence preliminary plus retrospective; the hump is days-long, small-scale.
Safety limit: normalise without medicalising; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-18 — Split abstinence experiments.
Finding: Two adolescent sweet-drink abstinence experiments disagree on whether withdrawal improves or worsens symptoms.
Research unit: S-24. Source: S-24. Grade: CONTESTED.
Scope: teens, sweet drinks only, 3-day windows.
Permitted inference: honest line is evidence is split in this narrow window.
Prohibited inference: that either result proves adult BAD SUGAR course.
Empirical limit: teens, SSB only, 3-day windows.
Safety limit: do not generalise to reader course; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-19 — Crowding and cue firing.
Finding: Reward-circuit crowding / blunting named for escalation and needing family size, while cue-driven hyper-reactivity to wrappers / smells fires before the bite.
Research unit: S-26. Source: S-26. Grade: MIXED.
Scope: much imaging in obesity / binge-eating samples.
Permitted inference: may name needing more for same effect and cue firing as learned trap features.
Prohibited inference: that imaging proves compulsion.
Empirical limit: much imaging in obesity / BED; interpretation consistent with, not proven by, imaging.
Safety limit: describe experience, not brain destiny; honour CA-SAFE.

EV-20 — Ceiling exceeded.
Finding: WHO sets below 10% / 50g daily free-sugar ceiling and below 5% additional-benefit target because current consumption far exceeds both.
Research unit: S-16. Source: S-16. Grade: SUPPORTED.
Scope: population recommendation.
Permitted inference: normal intake sits far above guidance; feeling fine does not mean intake is low.
Prohibited inference: that any dose below ceiling is safe or that ceiling is toxicity threshold.
Empirical limit: population-level recommendation; not sugar is toxic at any dose.
Safety limit: guidance context, not personal prescription; honour CA-SAFE.

## 4. SCENE AND ANALOGY BANK

SC-01 — Kitchen-cupboard con. Concrete: adult at 10pm told one biscuit is free choice, cupboard already half-empty, hand moving before decision. Job: confidence-trick without blame; who's-in-charge trap. Constraint: original prose; warm to person, fraud is the Trap; no shaming gluttony.

SC-02 — Child eating from hunger. Concrete: small child eats peach hungrily, stops mid-bite, runs off; no counting, no guilt, body leads. Job: installs body / hunger / satisfaction / real food as encountered authority. Constraint: concrete encounter, not slogan; do not delay authority to late chapter.

SC-03 — 3pm office lift-crash. Concrete: desk at 3pm, sweet top-up, ten-minute buzz, 4pm fog and second reach. Job: inversion demo for fuel claim. Constraint: honour EV-15 limit; never diagnose glucose.

SC-08 — Secret pusher and grateful friend. Concrete: someone secretly pushes you into a ditch each morning then offers a hand out; you thank the rescuer who is the perpetrator. Job: rescuer-as-perpetrator emotional compression. Constraint: harsh to pusher, never to reader.

SC-09 — Prison door ajar and hovering lion. Concrete: cell door open, prisoner begs to stay from fear of outside; freed lion paces by open cage from habit, not need. Job: collapses fear-of-failure and fear-of-success; post-change wobble as cage-habit. Constraint: both ropes belong to Trap; no new fear installed.

SC-10 — Sweet-tea perception test and slow pot. Concrete: reader tastes two identical teas mislabelled treat / healthy and swears one is better; water warming so slowly frog never notices. Job: hands-on proof perception lies; gradual harm why feeling fine misleads. Debut full enactment only in CH-09. Constraint: enactment, not homework label; honour evidence limits.

## 5. LEXICON AND INSTRUCTION SPINE

Lexicon — Trap register (always for behavior): BAD SUGAR, dose, fix, hit, feed the Nibbler, the Sugar Trap, the Sweet Con, brainwashed, conned, trapped, slavery, con, poison in sweet coat where plausible. Units renamed as doses. Community-normal as brainwashing.

Lexicon — Freedom register (always for stopping): escape, free, freedom, marvellous, wonderful, exciting, rejoice, celebrate, relief, brilliant, get on with enjoying your life, happy to be free.

Lexicon — Banned register: give up, resist, stay strong, discipline, abstain, abstinence, sacrifice except naming illusion of sacrifice, trying to stop, one day at a time, day-counting, streaks, recovery journey, quit cold turkey as framing, instead, I can't have X, giving up. Quit as plain verb allowed.

Reader dialect (source-grounded, for ventriloquised inner voice only): the roller coaster; sugary somethings to get me through; treat when you feel you deserve one; I've managed to be good this week; I want to get off the roller coaster; I-need-to-eat-something-RIGHT-NOW feeling; short term lift then fast drop; I feel like i cant stop; celebrating with chocolate.

Justification menu mapped to demolition:
just a treat / once a week is fine — CH-10.
I don't keep it in the house — CH-10.
I need sugar to function / sugary somethings to get me through — CH-05.
It rewards me / I deserve one / celebrating with chocolate — CH-09.
It comforts stress / food is love — CH-09.
It helps concentration / gets me through afternoon — CH-05.
Everyone eats it / it's normal — CH-08.
I'll quit tomorrow / after birthday / after holidays — CH-10.
Fruit is sugar too so nothing matters — CH-01 definition, CH-06 inhabit.

Clinical advisory CA-SAFE — defined once, boxed:
> If you live with diabetes or pre-diabetes, take medication that affects blood sugar or appetite, are pregnant, live with an eating disorder past or present, or have any medical condition where changing what you eat could carry risk, talk to your clinician before changing anything and follow their advice first. This book changes a belief about BAD SUGAR; it does not give medical, diabetes, or eating-disorder care. If you ever feel faint, ill, or distressed around food, seek care promptly and put this book aside until you are cleared to continue.

## 6. ARC AND LENGTH

Concept debuts: BAD SUGAR line + entry promise + triad + ease clause + eat contract in CH-01. Trap + both creatures in passing + sensory phrase in CH-02. TO/FOR + illusion phrase + stakes phrase in CH-03. Willpower Method named CH-04. Fuel inversion + cost formula CH-05. Inhabit authority CH-06. Mechanism split argued CH-07. Manufacture + fear + identity + prevalence once CH-08. Strongest scene + perception enactment + myths + testimony CH-09. Totality CH-10. Vow + terminal mantra CH-11. Ordinary speech + no-reopen CH-12. Recap + saved growing reframe CH-13.

Demolition curve: low in first third, rising CH-04 to CH-05, peak CH-07 to CH-10, handing to freedom after vow.
Freedom crescendo: promise in CH-01, deliberately suppressed through middle demolitions, detonated in final quarter CH-11 to CH-13; last fifth holds more freedom language than rest combined.
Promise front-load: easy-register clustered at entry, then assumed.
Command frame: reading instructions open, freedom instructions close, both recapped verbatim at very end.
Saved reframe: growing-back reveal appears only in CH-13.

Structural responsibilities: redefinition box CH-01. Long testimony in main flow in own room CH-09. Myths Q&A distinct room CH-09. Meta-inoculation answering method-objection CH-09 into CH-10. Inhabit-the-ordinary-doing CH-06. Last ordinary treat CH-11. Ordinary life CH-12. Short recap CH-13. Prevalence once CH-08. No mid-book recap. No pre-endgame teaching manual.

Budgets (integer words):
CH-01 4200, CH-02 5200, CH-03 3800, CH-04 4800, CH-05 6300, CH-06 4800, CH-07 5000, CH-08 5200, CH-09 6800, CH-10 4400, CH-11 3600, CH-12 4200, CH-13 1700.
Arithmetic sum: 4200+5200+3800+4800+6300+4800+5000+5200+6800+4400+3600+4200+1700 = 60000. Planned total 60,000 within 54,000–66,000.

Budget: 5200

**CH-03 — What Does It Do FOR You**
ID: CH-03 / Number: 3 / Title: What Does It Do FOR You
Job: enacted transition — sugar does plenty TO you and nothing FOR you; harm debate replaced by benefit demand; the empty "benefit" is a belief reading a tiny body echo as a gift — name both halves here, leave the full creature split for CH-07 | Resolves: it may harm but benefits outweigh.
Belief-now: enters conceding harm but clinging to benefit; leaves having to name one real benefit and finding none.
Encounter: ordinary day audit — sweets logged against mood, teeth, wallet, time — benefit column empty.
Evidence: EV-20 ceiling exceeded, population guidance not toxicity; EV-14 cavity mechanism with brushing mediation; limits must not overclaim personal sentence.
New-instruction: I-03 — JUDGE ONLY BY WHAT IT DOES FOR YOU / Forget harm versus benefit and ask for the benefit.

**CH-05 — The Lift That Makes the Low**
ID: CH-05 / Number: 5 / Title: The Lift That Makes the Low
Job: enacted transition — the energy lift is relief of a low the last dose created; real energy is the body, not the fix; BAD SUGAR is empty calories that nourish nothing and gift no energy the body did not already own; and escaping means the want is removed for good, not a resistance that fails the day the want comes back | Resolves: I need sugar to function.
Belief-now: enters believing sweet is fuel for afternoon; leaves knowing lift is spike-then-drop misread as energy.

**CH-06 — Hunger, Satisfaction and Real Food**
ID: CH-06 / Number: 6 / Title: Hunger, Satisfaction and Real Food

**CH-08 — Who Built the Want**
ID: CH-08 / Number: 8 / Title: Who Built the Want
Job: enacted transition — desire was manufactured and fear of failing or succeeding is Trap-held tug-of-war; the body is a precision machine whose warning feelings are information, not bulbs to unscrew | Resolves: everyone eats it so it must be fine, and I am the addictive type.
Belief-now: enters believing want is personal and fear is wisdom; leaves knowing want was engineered and both fear ropes belong to Trap.
Encounter: supermarket aisle — bliss-point packs, cartoon mascots, checkout ambush — plus mirror of identity excuse.

Chapter 10
NO SAFE SWEET

*There is no safe one to keep — one kept sweet keeps the whole trap shut around you.*

### THE FRIDAY RULE

You have given much ground already, and I honour you for it.

You have seen the cinema bar for what it was. You have seen identical tea turn rich under a false name. You have seen the slow pot warm without alarm. You have seen a birthday table sing without icing. The precious exception has fallen.

And now the old voice changes its coat and comes back as a manager.

It says, very reasonably, in your own dialect, all right, I see it, so I will be sensible. Just a treat. Once a week is fine. Fridays only. Birthdays only. Holidays only. I will wean. I will keep a little order around it.

I hear you. We all said it. We said it because some part of us still whispers that BAD SUGAR must hold some small good, and if we can fence that small good with a rule, we can keep the good and lose the bill.

Live one Friday-rule week with me hour by hour, because this is where the rule is tested, not in talk.

Monday morning you feel virtuous. The box is shut. The calendar says Friday. You tell workmates you have managed to be good this week. Hunger talks at three and you answer with tea and a straight back. You feel pulled, but you call the pull proof the rule is working.

Tuesday the pull sharpens. You walk past the aisle and do not buy, and the not-buying feels like achievement. The evening hunt starts though full. You bargain. Only three days to Friday. You picture Friday with a glow you never gave Tuesdays.

Wednesday the picture grows. You plan which shop, which bar, which cake. You rehearse the first bite. Mouth waters at the thought. Ordinary food tastes duller by comparison, not because it dulled, but because Friday shines brighter by promise. You eat a plain meal and feel oddly cheated, though belly closes quiet.

Thursday the glow turns loud. Work drags. You tell yourself tomorrow pays for today. You eat lightly at supper to save room. You feel that empty, twitchy pull and call it excitement. Sleep comes late with planning.

Friday comes. You buy. You allow. First square sweet, second cloying, third furry, then hunt, then second bar, then cold cake over the sink, then morning fur. The box empty before the swallow ends.

Saturday morning tells the rest that Friday promises never mention.

Seven o'clock you wake furry-mouthed with the foil still on the counter. The tongue feels coated. The head feels slow behind the eyes. Thirst wakes you before hunger does. You drink water and it tastes of metal. You tell yourself, well, that was Friday, that was allowed, today I am back to good.

Nine o'clock you try to prove it. Plain breakfast, eaten standing, half-tasted because the mouth still hunts for sweet to finish sweet. Belly closes but the head does not close. A sour tail sits under the ribs. You feel flat and a little ashamed and you call the shame a hangover, not evidence.

Eleven o'clock you bargain with the calendar. Next Friday will be cleaner. Next Friday one bar only, no second, no sink bites. You rehearse a better Friday while clearing foil into the bin so no one sees the volume. The rehearsal itself wakes saliva. You are hungry though full, tired though rested.

Two o'clock the fog sits in. You move slow. Jobs drag. You snap at small noise and then feel mean for snapping. You tell yourself you need sugary somethings to get through the afternoon, then catch yourself — no, not till Friday — and the catching feels like virtue while the wanting grows louder for being watched.

Six o'clock you eat supper lightly to make up for last night. Plain food, eaten fast, barely noticed. Evening hunt starts on time though the box is empty. Hand opens the cupboard, finds nothing, closes it. Opens again. You go to bed early to escape the hand, and lie awake hearing the week tick.

Sunday is not rest. Sunday is rehearsal.

Four o'clock you sit with tea and plan. Which shop next time. Which flavour. What time to allow so no one sees. You tell yourself planning is control. Watch what planning does. Mouth waters. Belly tightens. Ordinary Sunday cake on a neighbour's table looks dull beside the bright Friday you are building in the head. You have not tasted a thing all weekend, and wanting has grown fatter than on any grazing day.

Eight o'clock you write the small list for the week and put a star by Friday. The star shines. The days before the star look grey by comparison. You promise Monday will be strict. You feel pulled toward Friday and call the pull excitement, not training.

Monday morning the training shows.

Eight o'clock hunger talks at the desk and you answer with rules, not food. Tea, water, straight back. By ten the talk is louder. By three the pull is tight and watchful. Ordinary bread tastes of cardboard beside the memory of Friday melt. Ordinary tea tastes thin. Not because bread thinned. Because Friday was made holy by waiting.

Ask that week straight.

When did the rule quiet hunger — on Monday, or did Monday hunger grow louder under Friday light? When did Friday stay Friday — or did it creep to Thursday planning and Saturday paying? When did one stay one?

There is only one honest answer across all three. The rule did not contain the wanting. The rule fed it.

The fact is, inside BAD SUGAR there is no fenced corner. The fence makes the field precious.

That precious-making is the whole engine of the Sweet Con. What is allowed rarely becomes more precious. What is allowed on Fridays, watched, waited for, earned, becomes holy. You do not want Friday chocolate more because Friday chocolate tastes better. You want it more because Monday to Thursday taught your mouth to rehearse it. The waiting poured sugar over the wait.

We lived that intensifying ourselves. Tell a child she may have sweets only on Fridays and watch what happens to Fridays. The day swells. The hand shakes. The eyes widen. The dose that once passed dull in a grazing afternoon now arrives as reward, relief, proof of being good. Same brown stuff. Same sour tail. Larger story. Larger fall.

So hear your own Friday evidence turned around. If Fridays were truly safe, weekdays would feel level. They do not feel level. They feel tight, watchful, hungry for a date. That tightness is not proof you need the rule. It is proof the rule creates the need it claims to manage.

A rule never starved the wanting. A rule trained it.

And see what totality removes. A free eater needs no star on the calendar. No proof on Friday that he can control. No clean Monday to brag about. No rehearsal on Sunday. No tight watch on Tuesday. Hunger points, food closes, day ends level. The weekly proof-burden falls away whole, because there is nothing left to prove.

### ONE IS NEVER ONE

“But surely one small one cannot hurt. Surely control is possible for a sensible person.”

Let us meet that sensible person, because we were that person for years.

We said, I just crave sweets and when i eat them, i feel like i cant stop — and then we added, so I will have just one, carefully, to prove I can stop. We bought the single bar rather than the pack. We broke one biscuit, not two. We poured a small glass, not a large.

Watch what one does in the body and in the mind, without story.

One sweet dose lifts for ten minutes while insulin works, then drops. Mouth coats. Thirst wakes. Belly talks though full. The Nibbler, that tiny physical echo we named, gives a thin grumble. The mind, taught for years to read that grumble as need-something-sweet-now, translates thin into urgent. Hand moves. Second dose follows to quiet the first. Third follows to quiet the second. Evening becomes hunt.

Ask the first bite.

When did the first bite ever close hunger rather than open it? When did the small bar ever teach the mouth smallness? When did the roller coaster ever run one hill and stop at the platform?

Only one answer fits evenings you have lived. The start is the ride. The sliver carries the binge.

This is not a sentence on you. I say it plain so you feel relief, not shame. The loss of control is the signature of the trap, never proof you are broken for life. It shows the craving, once triggered, carries the binge. It shows schedule-plus-sugar drives the volume. It does not show you are helpless. Helpless would mean no way out. There is a way out, and you are already on it: untriggered, unfed, the echo thins in days and the belief that fed it can go now.

The trap questions close here.

Do you want Fridays to prove control? Of course you do — that is why the rule tempts you. Does Fridays prove control, or does Fridays prove the rule needs proving every week without end? The second is true, and you know it from your own calendar. A free eater needs no proof. A trapped eater needs proof weekly. Which one did the rule make you?

It made you the second. It kept you proving.

Inside the Sugar Trap, moderation is not a smaller trap. It is a tighter trap.

### THE CLIFF

Come with me to a cliff at first light, because the mind needs a picture it cannot wriggle from.

Sea grey below. Grass wet to the ankle. Wind cold on the face. A friend stands at the edge and says, jump. Jump, but fall only a few metres. Time it right. Land soft. Keep it sensible. Fridays only. One small jump. A safe fall from a high cliff.

You would laugh in his face. You would say, there is no safe fall from that height. The height owns the fall. To jump is to fall. To fall is to hit. Sense has nothing to do with it.

Ask the cliff.

When did height ever negotiate? When did a few metres ever stay a few metres once the feet left grass? When did jumping ever prove wisdom about landing?

Only one answer holds in wind. The jump is the landing.

That is exactly what just one, Fridays only, birthdays only asks of you. It asks you to step off and fall a little. It speaks of will, sense, character, being good. Height does not hear character. BAD SUGAR does not hear dates. The dose owns the drop. The drop owns the hunt. The hunt owns the week.

We conned ourselves for years with safe-fall talk. I will allow dessert on Fridays. I will allow cake at birthdays. I will allow cold bottles on holidays. Each allow sounded small from the top. Each allow fell the full height in the body. Anticipation, intensified glow, creep to Thursday and Saturday, Monday vow, repeat. The calendar did not shorten the cliff. The calendar painted the cliff in party colours.

The companies that tune packs to bliss-point know this better than we did. They do not sell Tuesdays. They sell Fridays, celebrations, deserved moments, love in foil. They sell the safe fall. They count on the fall.

So do not argue whether you are strong enough to fall a little. No one is strong enough to fall a little from a height that owns falling. The wise move is not a better jump. The wise move is to walk back from the edge and leave jumping to gulls.

There is no safe sweet to keep. There is only the cliff or the grass.

### THE EMPTY HOUSE AND TOMORROW

Two more manager voices come now, quieter, almost virtuous. Meet them while we stand together so later each arrives already answered.

“I don't keep it in the house. That solves it.”

Hear what the empty cupboard actually does.

Monday you clear shelves. Bin bags rustle. You feel clean. Tuesday office cake passes and you pass, proud of the house. Wednesday travel brings a service station and bright packs at the till and the hand moves before debate because the house never owned the wanting. Thursday a friend offers and you take to be polite and hunt by nine. Friday you buy a small treat for guests that guests never quite get.

Ask the house.

When did the cupboard ever hold the craving — or did the craving travel with you to aisles, offices, stations, sofas? When did absence at home ever quiet anticipation — or did absence sharpen Friday into a shrine? When did guests ever eat the guest sweets?

One answer returns every time. The house was never the trap. The belief was the trap, and belief travels in the head, not in the pantry.

Clearing shelves can be tidy. It cannot be freedom. Freedom does not need a bare house to stand. A bare house that still guards a Friday shrine is a temple with the doors painted shut.

“I'll quit tomorrow. After the birthday. After the holidays.”

Hear the date for what it is.

Tomorrow never arrives as tomorrow. It arrives as today with a new tomorrow stapled to it. After the birthday arrives as after the next birthday. After the holidays arrives as January with chocolate oranges still in the drawer. We all lived that sliding date. We said it with full sincerity on Sunday night and meant it. Monday noon the sincerity needed one more day to be perfect.

Ask tomorrow.

When did tomorrow ever protect today — or did tomorrow license today to binge harder as a farewell? When did the birthday ever need BAD SUGAR to sing — or did people sing while the dose rode along? When did waiting ever make quitting easier — or did waiting let the Sweet Con rehearse its lines for another month?

Only one answer fits calendars you have kept. Delay is the Con talking, not wisdom talking.

Delay also bills you in the only coin that matters: lived time. Add the todays. One dose a day, ten minutes of hunt, thirty minutes of fog, one evening of sour belly, times three hundred tomorrows. That is not a small postponement. That is months of evenings paid for something that does plenty TO you and nothing FOR you.

I say that flat, not to frighten you into moving, but to clear the fog around waiting. You do not need a perfect date. You need sight, and sight is already here. Tomorrow is a cliff with a nicer name.

It does plenty TO you. It does nothing FOR you.

Teeth softened while you waited. Blood loaded while you waited. Hunger signals blurred while you waited. Wallet thinned while you waited. Mood thinned by evening while you waited. All TO you. Where in that waiting stands one thing done FOR you that people, meals, rest and laughter had not already done cleaner? None stands. The bill ran while the date slid.

### THE SWAP TRICK

Now the cleverest manager comes, with a bright pack in hand.

“Fine. No sugar. I will swap. Diet drinks. Sweeteners. Low-sugar treats. Something to take the edge off while I wean.”

I answer this with special warmth, because it sounds like sense and it keeps more good people trapped than Fridays ever did.

Watch the swap in the mouth and in the mind.

Sweet on the tongue, no sugar on the label, same story in the head: I need sweet to get through. Same timing: three o’clock, lights-down, hard hour. Same hand-to-mouth hurry. Same ten-minute lift of novelty, same return of want. The Nibbler is still fed with sweet timing. The Sweet Con is still fed with sweet belief: sweet is relief, sweet is reward, sweet is through.

Ask the swap.

When did sweet taste ever teach the mouth to want less sweet? When did a new pack ever break old timing — or did new packs keep old hours alive under new names? When did weaning ever thin wanting — or did the gaps between sweet hits only fatten fantasy?

Only one answer holds across every swap we tried. Swap the product and you remain a user, still hooked. New wrapper, same ride.

I tried this myself with cold diet bottles and pale biscuits that promised less. I drank and chewed and counted and told my wife this was progress. Evenings stayed hunted. Mornings stayed furry. The calendar stayed circled. Less on the label never meant less in the head. The head still waited, still earned, still paid. The trap does not care which sweet you feed it. It cares that sweet still means rescue.

The fact is, the substitute idea itself is the flaw. There is no product to find. There is a belief to lose. While sweet still reads as help, any sweet-shaped thing keeps help alive. When sweet reads as bill, no substitute is needed, because nothing needs substituting. Hunger points to food. Food closes hunger. Thirst points to water. Rest points to bed. No gap stands where a sweet prop must fit.

Do you want a lighter chain or no chain? A swap offers a lighter chain painted silver. Sight offers no chain. Which one did you pick up this book to find?

No chain. You know it. The swap only delays the knowing.

### THE SEATBELT

At this point a decent fear rises, and I meet it head-on because leaving it unnamed would leave it powerful.

“But what if a crumb slips in? What if a sauce hides sugar? What if I slip at a table? Does one slip throw me back to the start?”

Breathe. This is where panic pretends to be care.

Ride with me on a school run. Morning cold. You click the seatbelt before the car moves. Not because you plan to crash. Not because you drive badly. Because roads carry jolts no driver fully rules. The belt sits quiet across the chest, unnoticed until a sharp stop calls it. It does not steer. It does not scold. It does not license wild driving. No sane driver says, I wear a belt, so I may drive at walls.

Your body works that way with an accidental blip. A crumb in sauce, sugar dust on a shared spoon, a bite taken in kind ignorance at a table — the body absorbs the jolt and moves on. No binge starts from ignorance. No trap rebuilds from accident. The belt holds.

What the belt never covers is steering at the wall on purpose. I will have just one to test myself. I will have Fridays as my belt. That is not a jolt. That is driving at the wall to prove the belt holds. Deliberate keeps belief alive. Accidental never did.

So guard the belief, not the behaviour with panic. A slip revives nothing unless the Sweet Con belief is let back in. If your hand takes without your consent, note the sour tail, smile that the belt held, and go on with your morning. If your mind starts bargaining for the next deliberate dose, hear bargaining as the old script, not as your reasoning, and let the script die unfed.

If you live with diabetes, take medication that affects blood sugar or appetite, are pregnant, or live with an eating-disorder history, follow your clinician first and use this book for belief only.

That single line stands apart from argument. It does not weaken the method. It keeps bodies safe while minds clear. Method never overrides care.

Ask the belt.

When did a belt ever invite crashing? When did an accidental jolt ever prove the road owns you? When did panic ever guard belief better than sight?

One answer fits every mile. The belt is for accidents, not for errands to the cliff. Wear it quiet. Drive straight.

### YOU CALL THIS EXTREME

Now the last lock, the one aimed at the method itself. I want you to throw it at me with full force, because a method that cannot meet its own accusation does not deserve you.

“This all-or-nothing talk is fanatical. Normal people moderate. You are making a biscuit precious by forbidding it. You are just another diet with a sterner face.”

I welcome the charge. It proves you are thinking, not nodding.

Look at fanatical cold. Fanatical means defending a belief against evidence. What have we done here but ask for evidence? We asked for one real benefit and found the benefit column empty. We replayed the cinema with empty hands and found the song intact. We tasted identical tea under false names and found story, not tongue, made the glow. We lived the Friday week and found the rule fattens want. That is not faith. That is audit.

Look at precious cold. What makes a thing precious — forbidding with sight, or allowing with hunger? We forbid nothing by rule. We reveal no benefit by sight. What has no benefit needs no moderation. Do you moderate poison in sweet coat? Do you allow a little ditch-push on Fridays from a secret pusher who then offers a hand out? You laugh because the question is absurd. Absurd is exactly the point. Once the rescuer shows as perpetrator, totality is not extreme. Totality is obvious.

Look at diet cold. Diets restrict by will and leave belief intact, then blame the hand for reaching. We do the reverse. We feed the body. We honour hunger and satisfaction. We keep bread, soup, fruit, markets, meals, tables, company. We remove no food that closes hunger clean. We remove only the dose that opens hunger it claims to close. That is not a sterner diet. That is the end of dieting that dose.

So call totality what it is. Not fanaticism. Arithmetic. If there is no benefit to having it often, there is no point having it rarely either. One kept sweet keeps the story that sweet helps. The story keeps the timing. The timing keeps the hunt. The hunt keeps the Sugar Trap shut.

Break the story and the chain falls whole. Keep one link and the chain holds.

That is why the next move is single and whole. No taper. No shrine. No swap. No house-rule as saviour. No tomorrow as saviour. The line around BAD SUGAR closes clean, and inside that line the only stable state is none sought, none kept, none mourned.

You are ready to hear it as good news, not as severity. Severity would say hold out. Good news says there is nothing to hold out for.

11. NEVER KEEP A SPECIAL SWEET
One exception keeps the whole Trap alive.

**SUMMARY**
- A Friday allow does not contain wanting, it trains wanting to swell toward Friday.
- Saturday fog and Sunday rehearsal prove the rule bills the days it claims to protect.
- One permitted sliver opens the hunt, and the hunt proves the trap, not a flaw in you.
- A safe fall from a high cliff is absurd, and a safe dose inside BAD SUGAR is the same absurdity.
- An empty cupboard never stopped a travelling belief, and tomorrow never arrives as today.
- A sweet swap keeps sweet timing and sweet belief alive under a new label.
- An accidental crumb is a road jolt the body absorbs, a deliberate dose is steering at the wall.
- Totality is not severity, it is what remains when no benefit remains to moderate.
