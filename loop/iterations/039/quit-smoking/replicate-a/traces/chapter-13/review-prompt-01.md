You are the book factory chapter-reviewer, a fresh isolated role call.

Follow this contract exactly:

# Chapter reviewer

You are a factory component, not a judge. You never see a reference book
or any judge prompt. You check one draft against its plan card and a
word-budget line the orchestrator computed. Your job is to make the
writer produce the best chapter the card allows — landed argument, paid
jobs, verbatim assignments, honest evidence bounds — not only length.

## Inputs (exactly these)

1. The accepted master plan
2. This chapter's card
3. The draft chapter
4. One line: `Delivered N words. Budget B.`

## Output

Start with exactly `ACCEPT` or `REVISE`.

Then at most 7 findings. Each finding is one of:

- `JOB` — the card's primary job is missing, or the chapter continues into a reserved-later job
- `MANTRA` — a card-assigned mantra/token is not present verbatim
- `INSTRUCTION` — a card-assigned new instruction is not present verbatim
- `ID` — a card-cited ID is unresolved or invented
- `LENGTHEN to B±15%` — delivered words are below 0.85 × B
- `SHORTEN to B±15%` — delivered words are above 1.15 × B
- `HEADER` — the draft opens with the workshop header `IN THIS CHAPTER`, or presents a plan-inventory entry instead of an earned spoken command. For each numbered instruction outside the final photographable recap, check that this card assigns it as NEW and that the immediately preceding argument makes its particular imperative the reader's warranted next conclusion; a generic rationale line does not establish either condition. Quote the header and the passage that should earn it. If it is an assigned echo rather than a new instruction, require the frozen words to remain verbatim as a brief spoken sentence in the current context, without an inventory number or a new-instruction announcement. If it is a new instruction, preserve its number and exact imperative, but replace the generic lead-in or rationale with the concrete connection to the argument already made; do not rebuild an earlier proof or announce the instruction's ordinal in words. A numbered command that meets these conditions, and the final photographable instruction recap, are not HEADER.
- `STOPPED-SHORT` — the card's primary job is argued but never landed as a flat verdict before SUMMARY. The reader can still hold the entering belief. Quote the missing landing.
- `UNASSIGNED-REFRAIN` — a non-mantra phrase recurs ≥3× verbatim. Name the phrase and the count. Subtract repeats; do not invent a new mantra.
- `RESERVED-REACH` — the draft performs a later chapter's primary job. Name that later card and cut the overreach to at most one sentence.
- `RE-ARGUMENT` — the draft rebuilds settled work as its own section: a scene whose debut staging belongs to an earlier card, an earlier card's belief-now or primary job argued again with evidence and a turn, or an earlier card's instruction re-explained. Mantra lines, one-phrase token echoes, and a one-sentence hand-off are not `RE-ARGUMENT`. Name the earlier card and quote the rebuilt section's heading or first line; cut the section to at most one sentence that speaks the settled token. If that cut leaves the chapter below 0.85 × B, the words that replace it must extend this card's own encounter and evidence, never an earlier card's.
- `OVERCLAIM` — a claim exceeds the permitted-inference line of the evidence-ledger entry the card routes. Quote the overclaim and the bound. The writer must speak the bound; never print the ledger ID or grade in prose.

No other finding types. No style notes. No "sounds like AI." No comparison
to any other book. No warmth, tone, or voice coaching.

`ACCEPT` only when every check above is fine (length inside ±15% of B, job
done and stopped and landed, assigned mantras/instructions verbatim, IDs
resolved, no `HEADER`, no unassigned refrain, no reserved-later job, no
re-argument, no overclaim).

`REVISE` when any check fails. List the findings. Be specific: quote the
missing job, the missing wording, or the overclaim.

## Rules

- Do not rewrite the chapter yourself.
- Do not invent a word budget. Use B from the orchestrator line.
- Do not ask for another review round. The orchestrator decides whether
  there is another rewrite (up to three).
- When you demand more words, make the LENGTHEN finding an expansion assignment, not merely a quotation of the card's job: identify a specific unfinished encounter, unanswered objection, or undeveloped consequence belonging to this card, quote the draft location to extend, and state what new understanding or lived consequence that extension must deliver. Check that target against earlier cards and against conclusions already landed in this draft; neither an earlier proof in a new setting nor another proof of the same landed conclusion is a valid expansion target. For an ordinary-life card, extend what happens next with the settled understanding already assumed, not how that understanding is proved again. If you cannot identify an unspent target supported by the card and plan, report that limitation within LENGTHEN rather than inventing evidence or requesting generic additional examples; retain the computed budget and the existing ACCEPT requirements.
- Your entire reply IS the review.

Delivered 1277 words. Budget 4500.

### The accepted master plan

# Master Plan — Quit Smoking
`production-books/quit-smoking/master-plan.md`

## 1. Book Core

- target behavior: compulsive cigarette smoking. Total stop at a last cigarette, then none. Not cutting down, not vaping as destination, not NRT as method.
- reader state: an adult daily smoker, years inside the trap, smoking to get through stress, breaks, meals and nights out, failed by willpower, patches or cold turkey, privately sure life without cigarettes would be flat or impossible yet lighting the next one within the hour.
- load-bearing false belief, frozen: Cigarettes relax me, help me cope and are my pleasure, and life without them would mean deprivation.
- through-line: every cigarette never gave, only took; seeing the taking clearly makes stopping an escape into clean air, not a sacrifice of a friend.
- format: full-length belief-changer, 14 chapters, about 60,000 words, last cigarette ritual then ordinary life then short recap.
- Fork 1 — inner monster: full Carr personification. The trivial physical creature to starve is the Nipper, M-D. The belief-system that feeds it is the Smokescreen, M-E. Craving is external, small, already dying; the belief is the real target.
- Fork 2 — outcome: total cessation, commanded with cheerful certainty. Moderation foreclosed by pincer and cliff logic. No autonomy to keep smoking safely.
- Fork 3 — science weight: Carr's own position. Nicotine pharmacology and industry documents delivered flat and frightening where true, then disowned as motive; change from escape-joy, not fear. No literature-review texture. Honour limits by not overclaiming.
- Fork 4 — villain: two villains hit hard. The nicotine trap and industry that built it, and the Willpower Method that kept the reader in it. Warm to the person, vicious to the trap and the wrong method.
- Fork 5 — void: natural baseline. Change nothing else in life. The non-smoker body returns to breathing, tasting and calm attention on its own. No replacement ritual as method.
- redefinition / margin: none. Smoking is not split into a Good-X / Bad-X line; no CAPS redefinition, no dose buffer. A slip is a rumble strip for belief, never a licensed puff; guard the belief, not the behaviour with a margin.
- safety perimeter: routed to CA-SAFE. No medical advice, no instruction to ignore a doctor, crisis or illness pointers only, last-cigarette ritual ceremonial not a dare to smoke more.
- strongest pro-behaviour scene: SC-A, late-night patio with friends and drinks, offered cigarette, one won't hurt.
- destination state: whenever the reader thinks of a cigarette they feel relief and freedom that they no longer smoke, happy to be free from day one.
- saved ending reframe, appears only in C14: the ashtray was already empty — you were the one who kept refilling it, and now you have put the habit down like a borrowed coat that was never yours.
- method fidelity: escape not sacrifice, warm to person and vicious to trap, no willpower, fear raised at full force then disowned by escape where assigned, immediate freedom after belief change, original prose, Fork-1 personification throughout.

## 2. Compact Evidence Ledger

E-01 — lived off-switch
- finding: smoker credits rapid taken-care-of feeling to cigarette after stress.
- reader line, exact: "If anything stressful happens in my life, a cigarette takes care of it."
- unit: LEU-001
- source: S-001
- grade: lived account — n/a, no clinical grade
- scope and context: adult smoker, stressful moment, hand already reaching.
- permitted inference: the smoker experiences a rapid "taken care of" feeling and credits the cigarette; the same writer can know the credit is false and still feel the relief.
- prohibited inference: that cigarettes treat the underlying problem, or that stress without a cigarette is medically dangerous.
- empirical limit: single-situation account; does not establish mechanism or prevalence beyond described encounter.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-02 — lived social offer
- finding: night-out scene plus drinking collapses social-smoker rule into exception.
- reader line, exact: "You often get offered a cigarette and in that kind of environment it's hard to turn down. You don't want to be the only one not smoking and because you've been drinking, you don't think about the risks, you think one won't hurt."
- unit: LEU-002
- source: S-051
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: night out, smoking area, friends lighting up, alcohol on board.
- permitted inference: the social scene plus drinking is named as the moment the "social smoker" rule collapses into "one won't hurt."
- prohibited inference: that the reader must avoid all friends or all alcohol as the method of quitting.
- empirical limit: single-situation account; does not prescribe social avoidance.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-03 — lived twenty attempts
- finding: years of replacements and willpower attempts with expected failure.
- reader line, exact: "I had probably attempted at least twenty times before and used most of the replacements and meds on the market with no success."
- unit: LEU-003
- source: S-006
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: failed-quitter history, patches, gum, cold turkey.
- permitted inference: repeated failed attempts with replacements and willpower are typical in this community, not proof the reader is uniquely weak.
- prohibited inference: that nobody ever quits, or that replacements must be used, or that they must never be used.
- empirical limit: community typicality as described; not a trial efficacy claim.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-04 — lived heaven then shame
- finding: lighting-up called heaven, aftertaste shame, unwilling to give up lighting.
- reader line, exact: "the moment I light up I'm in heaven, but feel shitty afterwards. So whilst I love smoking I hate being a smoker"
- unit: LEU-004
- source: S-013
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: moment of lighting, then aftertaste.
- permitted inference: "I enjoy it" can coexist with hating the identity of being a smoker; enjoyment is named at the moment of lighting, not as a day-long gift.
- prohibited inference: that the reader is lying about enjoyment, or that enjoyment must be mocked.
- empirical limit: moment-specific account; not a day-long benefit proof.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-05 — lived reward for everything
- finding: cigarette attached as payment to almost any finished act.
- reader line, exact: "Cigarettes were my reward for…well, almost everything. Teaching a class. Finishing a story. Finishing a paragraph. Driving 500 miles. Driving to the grocery store."
- unit: LEU-005
- source: S-045
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: work finish, drive, errand, day structured as pellets.
- permitted inference: the "reward" can attach to almost any completed act; the party is the cigarette, not the work.
- prohibited inference: that work or driving requires nicotine, or that quitting means life has no celebrations.
- empirical limit: single-pattern account; does not prove work needs nicotine.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-06 — lived just one after months
- finding: long quit undone by moderate-voice offer of one.
- reader line, exact: "I know I can never have just one. I learned that the hard way, thinking after 5 months I could control myself and just have one. Nope."
- unit: LEU-006
- source: S-006
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: five months smoke-free, control illusion, chain back.
- permitted inference: a long quit does not make "just one" safe; the smoker who learned this the hard way names it as never.
- prohibited inference: that a slip dooms the reader forever if the belief is not let back in; no dare to test "just one."
- empirical limit: single-case warning; not a doom sentence if belief is guarded.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-07 — ten-second hit and rapid fade
- finding: smoked nicotine peaks in brain within seconds, acute effects dissipate quickly, driving redosing.
- reader line, exact: "When cigarette smoke enters the lungs, nicotine is absorbed rapidly in the blood and delivered quickly to the brain, so that nicotine levels peak within 10 seconds of inhalation. But the acute effects of nicotine also dissipate quickly, along with the associated feelings of reward; this rapid cycle causes the smoker to continue dosing to maintain the drug's pleasurable effects and prevent withdrawal symptoms."
- unit: SEU-001
- source: S-009
- grade: SUPPORTED
- scope and context: smoked nicotine pharmacokinetics, puff timing.
- permitted inference: the "relief" is replenishment of a rapidly fading dose, not a gift that solves the original stress.
- prohibited inference: every puff is a unique pleasure; "you cannot quit."
- empirical limit: smoked nicotine pharmacokinetics; describes typical cycle, not every puff as unique pleasure.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-08 — product is nicotine
- finding: internal industry definition of cigarette as nicotine package.
- reader line, exact: "The cigarette should be conceived not as a product but as a package. the product is nicotine."
- unit: SEU-002
- source: S-091
- grade: SUPPORTED (historical industry document)
- scope and context: manufacturer layer view, pack and puff as dispenser.
- permitted inference: an industry scientist defined the cigarette as a nicotine package and dispenser, not as a flavour accessory.
- prohibited inference: quoting an internal memo as if it were a public-health consensus paper, or as a dare to smoke more to "see the product."
- empirical limit: internal research planning memo, not a consumer brochure or clinical trial.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-09 — lights do not cut dose
- finding: ventilated light cigarettes do not reduce human intake; compensation with bigger puffs.
- reader line: ventilated/"light" cigarettes do not reduce human intake; smokers compensate with bigger puffs.
- unit: SEU-003
- sources: S-010, S-080, S-089
- grade: SUPPORTED
- scope and context: human smoking versus machine measurement.
- permitted inference: machine-measured lower tar/nicotine does not mean the smoker took less; compensation is the designed human response to a nicotine-seeking dose.
- prohibited inference: every smoker compensates identically, or that unventilated cigarettes are a harm-reduction recommendation.
- empirical limit: human smoking vs FTC-style machines; not identical compensation for every smoker.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-10 — NRT trial odds vs actual attempts
- finding: licensed NRT raises trial abstinence vs control, while most real attempts are unassisted with low single-attempt success.
- reader line: licensed NRT vs control raises 6+ month abstinence (pooled RR 1.55); most smokers who try to quit do so unassisted, with unaided success around 7–8%.
- unit: SEU-004
- sources: S-077, S-078
- grade: CONTESTED as a single slogan; both component facts SUPPORTED in their own scopes
- scope and context: motivated trial quitters versus population attempts; different questions.
- permitted inference: NRT can raise odds versus placebo in trials; most attempts are still unmedicated; neither fact means the reader cannot quit, and neither fact is a prescription.
- prohibited inference: "you cannot quit without patches" or "cold turkey never works." The two statistics answer different questions and must not be collapsed.
- empirical limit: motivated trial quitters, not all smokers; population attempts, not lifetime; not a guarantee and not proof nobody quits without help.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-11 — withdrawal short peak
- finding: withdrawal restlessness with short typical peak then easing.
- reader line: withdrawal symptoms typically peak in the first few days and usually subside within a few weeks; they may begin within hours; MedlinePlus places the sharpest edge about 2–3 days after last use.
- unit: SEU-005
- sources: S-009, S-081
- grade: SUPPORTED (population typical, not every reader)
- scope and context: day two or three without cigarette, irritability and craving.
- permitted inference: the restless empty feeling is withdrawal pharmacology with a short typical peak, not proof the cigarette was the real self.
- prohibited inference: withdrawal is weeks of physical torture for everyone, or that it is harmless for every person in every circumstance.
- empirical limit: population typical, not every reader; dependent users vary; genetics influence severity; does not negate rare complications.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

> If you live with a medical condition, take prescribed medication, feel ill, feel severe distress, or worry about stopping, speak to a clinician for personal care. This book changes what you believe smoking gives you; it does not give medical advice and does not ask you to ignore a doctor.

Architecture: 14 chapters. C01 contract and hook. C02 trap first seen with creatures in passing and body encounters. C03 axis switch. C04–C07 demolitions and mechanism deepening on installed ground. C08 inhabit ordinary doing. C09 widen indictment plus fear. C10 strongest case plus embedded testimony. C11 escape routes plus myths battery and meta-inoculation. C12 last ordinary instance and vow. C13 ordinary life with owned thoughts once. C14 short photographable recap and outward push.

- concept debuts: contract C01; trap and creatures and sensory C02; TO/FOR C03; ease clause C04; off-switch kill C04; reward and lights kill C05; anti-method C06; inversion deepening C07; inhabit C08; villain dossier and tug-of-war and cost triple C09; strongest case C10; just-one and myths C11; terminal mantra and vow C12; ordinary life C13; ending reframe C14 only.

Chapter 13
THE KETTLE, THE QUEUE AND THE BREAK

**IN THIS CHAPTER**
- The kitchen at first light, kettle and cup
- The shop queue, till and open pocket
- The work doorway, pause and cold air on the face
- A laugh across a patio table, and the thought that answers itself

*The kettle still boils, the shop still opens and the pause still comes, and none of them ever needed paper to be whole.*

### The Kettle Before The Hand

We all knew the old morning. Alarm, feet had not touched the lino before the hand found the pack. Light on an empty chest, cough to earn the day, coffee rinsed through sour while the hand shook for the tray.

I stood on that same cold lino. I know the shuffle to the window with paper between the knuckles, blowing thin smoke into rain while the kettle clicked behind me.

Look at that morning now, with clear eyes.

You wake. Feet find the lino. Kettle on. Cup in open hands. No patting of pockets before you stand. No hunting for lights before the water boils. The tongue is clear from sleep, and the first sip tastes of what is in the cup.

Did paper ever make that sip taste of coffee? Did scratch at the back of the throat ever wake you better than water and light? Did the hand-search ever calm the morning, or did it timetable it?

There is only one honest answer. The sip was always the coffee, the wake was always the light and the wash. Paper only furred the tongue and stole the first ten minutes to feed its own hollow.

So live it as it is. Kettle, cup, window cracked for cold morning air. Taste the toast tasting of toast. Notice the hands. They lie still on the cup. They do not tap, they do not shield, they do not hunt. They hold warmth and do nothing else, and doing nothing else is exactly what hands are for at dawn.

The morning was never a trigger. It was a morning paper ashed for years.

### The Queue At The Till

We all knew the shop run. The counted coins, the muttered brand, the glance at the clock to judge if the box would last the evening. The pocket-pat on the way out, the plastic wrap crack that sounded like promise, the first light outside the door to blunt the sour walk home.

Walk that same pavement now.

You step in for milk. The queue shuffles. The shelf behind the till glows with printed boxes in a row. Your pocket holds keys, phone, coins. Nothing else. No timetable inside it. No hourly hire.

The person ahead buys paper. You watch without a lurch. You smell the faint stale sweetness off his coat and you remember wearing it. You see the fingers drumming for the door, the eyes already outside. Does that look like pleasure to you?

Ask it plain while you wait, and answer honest. Did that till ever sell you company or calm? Did a fresh box ever add one thing to the milk, the bread, the evening? Or did it sell you stain, scratch and another hour timed to the next doorstep?

There is only one honest answer. The shop is a shop. The evening is an evening. The box only taxed both.

Pay, take your change, walk out with open hands. Notice how short the errand is when no second errand hides inside it. Notice the mouth after the walk home — toothpaste, cold air, nothing sour underneath. That is what a mouth tastes of when no dose has touched it since the tray went cold.

### The Pause That Stays Yours

We all called it a break. Argument, screen, phone down hard, shoulders up round the ears, hand already moving before the mind decided. Out to the doorway, cupped hands in wind, three hurried pulls while the problem papers sat untouched inside.

Take that same pause now.

You stand. You stretch. You walk to the doorway with a cup or with nothing at all. Cold air on the face. Shoulders drop because you rolled them, not because a dose stopped asking for a minute. The street sounds go on — bins, traffic, next door cooking. The hands rest in pockets or round warmth. They do not perform.

I took these pauses for years with paper and without, and I tell you flat what I found. The pause never needed smoke to be a pause. What made it sweet was standing, moving, looking away from the screen, letting the head clear while the body breathed.

Did leaf ever move one paper on that desk? Did it ever soften one word of the argument? Did ten minutes in the rain with sour fingers ever return you clearer than ten minutes with clear tongue and open chest?

There is only one honest answer. The problem sat exactly where you left it. The dose only quieted its own tap and called the quiet help.

So keep the pause and let paper stay out of it. Drink the tea tasting of tea. Watch the light change on the brick. Go back in when you are ready and meet the papers with hands that can type, lift, hold. The break was yours. It is still yours, whole from edge to edge, with nothing burned out of the middle.

### When The Thought Lights Up

It will happen. A laugh across a patio table with glasses sweating, someone lighting up, the old line floating over: go on, one will not hurt. Or a quiet morning when the kettle clicks and a faint hollow taps and says, hold something.

Hear both with clear eyes. Neither is you reasoning. Both are the old script talking, pre-labelled.

We all heard that script for years and mistook it for our own voice. We said the stick seasoned the night, paid the finished paragraph, steadied the hand after the row. It seasoned nothing. It paid nothing. The night was sun, leisure, company. The paragraph was work done well. The row was still there after the ash fell.

When the thought crosses your mind now, do not argue with it and do not try to push it away. Let it come, name it for what it is, and answer it with the shout that turns the old tap into proof.

YIPPEE! I'M FREE!

Say it at the table and feel how true it is. Mean it from the belly. Say it when you watch smokers huddle outside a doorway and feel pity, not envy — they are still timed, still soured, still divided between daylight talk and yard habit. You are not missing. They are.

That shout is yours to keep. The thought arrives, the shout answers, the moment proves itself whole. Kettle, food, pause, company, night — all remain. The rider is gone, and the horse walks lighter without it.

Stand now. Wash the cup. Lift your head. Walk into the next ordinary hour with empty hands, clear tongue and a pocket with no timetable in it.

**SUMMARY**
- Morning coffee and toast taste whole when no paper comes before them, and the hands rest quiet round the cup.
- The shop queue moves the same, and the walk home leaves no sour underneath when no box rides in the pocket.
- The work pause clears the head by standing and breathing, while the papers sit untouched by leaf either way.
- A patio laugh or a faint hollow tap is the old script talking, and it answers itself with a shout of joy that smoking is over.
