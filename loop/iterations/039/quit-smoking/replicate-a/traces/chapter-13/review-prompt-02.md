You are the book factory chapter-reviewer, a fresh isolated role call.

Follow this contract exactly:

# Chapter reviewer

You are a factory component, not a judge. You never see a reference book
or any judge prompt. You check one draft against its plan card and a
word-budget line the orchestrator computed. Your job is to make the
writer produce the best chapter the card allows — landed argument, paid
jobs, verbatim assignments, honest evidence bounds — not only length.

## Inputs (exactly these)

1. The accepted master plan
2. This chapter's card
3. The draft chapter
4. One line: `Delivered N words. Budget B.`

## Output

Start with exactly `ACCEPT` or `REVISE`.

Then at most 7 findings. Each finding is one of:

- `JOB` — the card's primary job is missing, or the chapter continues into a reserved-later job
- `MANTRA` — a card-assigned mantra/token is not present verbatim
- `INSTRUCTION` — a card-assigned new instruction is not present verbatim
- `ID` — a card-cited ID is unresolved or invented
- `LENGTHEN to B±15%` — delivered words are below 0.85 × B
- `SHORTEN to B±15%` — delivered words are above 1.15 × B
- `HEADER` — the draft opens with the workshop header `IN THIS CHAPTER`, or presents a plan-inventory entry instead of an earned spoken command. For each numbered instruction outside the final photographable recap, check that this card assigns it as NEW and that the immediately preceding argument makes its particular imperative the reader's warranted next conclusion; a generic rationale line does not establish either condition. Quote the header and the passage that should earn it. If it is an assigned echo rather than a new instruction, require the frozen words to remain verbatim as a brief spoken sentence in the current context, without an inventory number or a new-instruction announcement. If it is a new instruction, preserve its number and exact imperative, but replace the generic lead-in or rationale with the concrete connection to the argument already made; do not rebuild an earlier proof or announce the instruction's ordinal in words. A numbered command that meets these conditions, and the final photographable instruction recap, are not HEADER.
- `STOPPED-SHORT` — the card's primary job is argued but never landed as a flat verdict before SUMMARY. The reader can still hold the entering belief. Quote the missing landing.
- `UNASSIGNED-REFRAIN` — a non-mantra phrase recurs ≥3× verbatim. Name the phrase and the count. Subtract repeats; do not invent a new mantra.
- `RESERVED-REACH` — the draft performs a later chapter's primary job. Name that later card and cut the overreach to at most one sentence.
- `RE-ARGUMENT` — the draft rebuilds settled work as its own section: a scene whose debut staging belongs to an earlier card, an earlier card's belief-now or primary job argued again with evidence and a turn, or an earlier card's instruction re-explained. Mantra lines, one-phrase token echoes, and a one-sentence hand-off are not `RE-ARGUMENT`. Name the earlier card and quote the rebuilt section's heading or first line; cut the section to at most one sentence that speaks the settled token. If that cut leaves the chapter below 0.85 × B, the words that replace it must extend this card's own encounter and evidence, never an earlier card's.
- `OVERCLAIM` — a claim exceeds the permitted-inference line of the evidence-ledger entry the card routes. Quote the overclaim and the bound. The writer must speak the bound; never print the ledger ID or grade in prose.

No other finding types. No style notes. No "sounds like AI." No comparison
to any other book. No warmth, tone, or voice coaching.

`ACCEPT` only when every check above is fine (length inside ±15% of B, job
done and stopped and landed, assigned mantras/instructions verbatim, IDs
resolved, no `HEADER`, no unassigned refrain, no reserved-later job, no
re-argument, no overclaim).

`REVISE` when any check fails. List the findings. Be specific: quote the
missing job, the missing wording, or the overclaim.

## Rules

- Do not rewrite the chapter yourself.
- Do not invent a word budget. Use B from the orchestrator line.
- Do not ask for another review round. The orchestrator decides whether
  there is another rewrite (up to three).
- When you demand more words, make the LENGTHEN finding an expansion assignment, not merely a quotation of the card's job: identify a specific unfinished encounter, unanswered objection, or undeveloped consequence belonging to this card, quote the draft location to extend, and state what new understanding or lived consequence that extension must deliver. Check that target against earlier cards and against conclusions already landed in this draft; neither an earlier proof in a new setting nor another proof of the same landed conclusion is a valid expansion target. For an ordinary-life card, extend what happens next with the settled understanding already assumed, not how that understanding is proved again. If you cannot identify an unspent target supported by the card and plan, report that limitation within LENGTHEN rather than inventing evidence or requesting generic additional examples; retain the computed budget and the existing ACCEPT requirements.
- Your entire reply IS the review.

Delivered 3353 words. Budget 4500.

### The accepted master plan

# Master Plan — Quit Smoking
`production-books/quit-smoking/master-plan.md`

## 1. Book Core

- target behavior: compulsive cigarette smoking. Total stop at a last cigarette, then none. Not cutting down, not vaping as destination, not NRT as method.
- reader state: an adult daily smoker, years inside the trap, smoking to get through stress, breaks, meals and nights out, failed by willpower, patches or cold turkey, privately sure life without cigarettes would be flat or impossible yet lighting the next one within the hour.
- load-bearing false belief, frozen: Cigarettes relax me, help me cope and are my pleasure, and life without them would mean deprivation.
- through-line: every cigarette never gave, only took; seeing the taking clearly makes stopping an escape into clean air, not a sacrifice of a friend.
- format: full-length belief-changer, 14 chapters, about 60,000 words, last cigarette ritual then ordinary life then short recap.
- Fork 1 — inner monster: full Carr personification. The trivial physical creature to starve is the Nipper, M-D. The belief-system that feeds it is the Smokescreen, M-E. Craving is external, small, already dying; the belief is the real target.
- Fork 2 — outcome: total cessation, commanded with cheerful certainty. Moderation foreclosed by pincer and cliff logic. No autonomy to keep smoking safely.
- Fork 3 — science weight: Carr's own position. Nicotine pharmacology and industry documents delivered flat and frightening where true, then disowned as motive; change from escape-joy, not fear. No literature-review texture. Honour limits by not overclaiming.
- Fork 4 — villain: two villains hit hard. The nicotine trap and industry that built it, and the Willpower Method that kept the reader in it. Warm to the person, vicious to the trap and the wrong method.
- Fork 5 — void: natural baseline. Change nothing else in life. The non-smoker body returns to breathing, tasting and calm attention on its own. No replacement ritual as method.
- redefinition / margin: none. Smoking is not split into a Good-X / Bad-X line; no CAPS redefinition, no dose buffer. A slip is a rumble strip for belief, never a licensed puff; guard the belief, not the behaviour with a margin.
- safety perimeter: routed to CA-SAFE. No medical advice, no instruction to ignore a doctor, crisis or illness pointers only, last-cigarette ritual ceremonial not a dare to smoke more.
- strongest pro-behaviour scene: SC-A, late-night patio with friends and drinks, offered cigarette, one won't hurt.
- destination state: whenever the reader thinks of a cigarette they feel relief and freedom that they no longer smoke, happy to be free from day one.
- saved ending reframe, appears only in C14: the ashtray was already empty — you were the one who kept refilling it, and now you have put the habit down like a borrowed coat that was never yours.
- method fidelity: escape not sacrifice, warm to person and vicious to trap, no willpower, fear raised at full force then disowned by escape where assigned, immediate freedom after belief change, original prose, Fork-1 personification throughout.

## 2. Compact Evidence Ledger

E-01 — lived off-switch
- finding: smoker credits rapid taken-care-of feeling to cigarette after stress.
- reader line, exact: "If anything stressful happens in my life, a cigarette takes care of it."
- unit: LEU-001
- source: S-001
- grade: lived account — n/a, no clinical grade
- scope and context: adult smoker, stressful moment, hand already reaching.
- permitted inference: the smoker experiences a rapid "taken care of" feeling and credits the cigarette; the same writer can know the credit is false and still feel the relief.
- prohibited inference: that cigarettes treat the underlying problem, or that stress without a cigarette is medically dangerous.
- empirical limit: single-situation account; does not establish mechanism or prevalence beyond described encounter.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-02 — lived social offer
- finding: night-out scene plus drinking collapses social-smoker rule into exception.
- reader line, exact: "You often get offered a cigarette and in that kind of environment it's hard to turn down. You don't want to be the only one not smoking and because you've been drinking, you don't think about the risks, you think one won't hurt."
- unit: LEU-002
- source: S-051
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: night out, smoking area, friends lighting up, alcohol on board.
- permitted inference: the social scene plus drinking is named as the moment the "social smoker" rule collapses into "one won't hurt."
- prohibited inference: that the reader must avoid all friends or all alcohol as the method of quitting.
- empirical limit: single-situation account; does not prescribe social avoidance.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-03 — lived twenty attempts
- finding: years of replacements and willpower attempts with expected failure.
- reader line, exact: "I had probably attempted at least twenty times before and used most of the replacements and meds on the market with no success."
- unit: LEU-003
- source: S-006
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: failed-quitter history, patches, gum, cold turkey.
- permitted inference: repeated failed attempts with replacements and willpower are typical in this community, not proof the reader is uniquely weak.
- prohibited inference: that nobody ever quits, or that replacements must be used, or that they must never be used.
- empirical limit: community typicality as described; not a trial efficacy claim.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-04 — lived heaven then shame
- finding: lighting-up called heaven, aftertaste shame, unwilling to give up lighting.
- reader line, exact: "the moment I light up I'm in heaven, but feel shitty afterwards. So whilst I love smoking I hate being a smoker"
- unit: LEU-004
- source: S-013
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: moment of lighting, then aftertaste.
- permitted inference: "I enjoy it" can coexist with hating the identity of being a smoker; enjoyment is named at the moment of lighting, not as a day-long gift.
- prohibited inference: that the reader is lying about enjoyment, or that enjoyment must be mocked.
- empirical limit: moment-specific account; not a day-long benefit proof.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-05 — lived reward for everything
- finding: cigarette attached as payment to almost any finished act.
- reader line, exact: "Cigarettes were my reward for…well, almost everything. Teaching a class. Finishing a story. Finishing a paragraph. Driving 500 miles. Driving to the grocery store."
- unit: LEU-005
- source: S-045
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: work finish, drive, errand, day structured as pellets.
- permitted inference: the "reward" can attach to almost any completed act; the party is the cigarette, not the work.
- prohibited inference: that work or driving requires nicotine, or that quitting means life has no celebrations.
- empirical limit: single-pattern account; does not prove work needs nicotine.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-06 — lived just one after months
- finding: long quit undone by moderate-voice offer of one.
- reader line, exact: "I know I can never have just one. I learned that the hard way, thinking after 5 months I could control myself and just have one. Nope."
- unit: LEU-006
- source: S-006
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: five months smoke-free, control illusion, chain back.
- permitted inference: a long quit does not make "just one" safe; the smoker who learned this the hard way names it as never.
- prohibited inference: that a slip dooms the reader forever if the belief is not let back in; no dare to test "just one."
- empirical limit: single-case warning; not a doom sentence if belief is guarded.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-07 — ten-second hit and rapid fade
- finding: smoked nicotine peaks in brain within seconds, acute effects dissipate quickly, driving redosing.
- reader line, exact: "When cigarette smoke enters the lungs, nicotine is absorbed rapidly in the blood and delivered quickly to the brain, so that nicotine levels peak within 10 seconds of inhalation. But the acute effects of nicotine also dissipate quickly, along with the associated feelings of reward; this rapid cycle causes the smoker to continue dosing to maintain the drug's pleasurable effects and prevent withdrawal symptoms."
- unit: SEU-001
- source: S-009
- grade: SUPPORTED
- scope and context: smoked nicotine pharmacokinetics, puff timing.
- permitted inference: the "relief" is replenishment of a rapidly fading dose, not a gift that solves the original stress.
- prohibited inference: every puff is a unique pleasure; "you cannot quit."
- empirical limit: smoked nicotine pharmacokinetics; describes typical cycle, not every puff as unique pleasure.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-08 — product is nicotine
- finding: internal industry definition of cigarette as nicotine package.
- reader line, exact: "The cigarette should be conceived not as a product but as a package. the product is nicotine."
- unit: SEU-002
- source: S-091
- grade: SUPPORTED (historical industry document)
- scope and context: manufacturer layer view, pack and puff as dispenser.
- permitted inference: an industry scientist defined the cigarette as a nicotine package and dispenser, not as a flavour accessory.
- prohibited inference: quoting an internal memo as if it were a public-health consensus paper, or as a dare to smoke more to "see the product."
- empirical limit: internal research planning memo, not a consumer brochure or clinical trial.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-09 — lights do not cut dose
- finding: ventilated light cigarettes do not reduce human intake; compensation with bigger puffs.
- reader line: ventilated/"light" cigarettes do not reduce human intake; smokers compensate with bigger puffs.
- unit: SEU-003
- sources: S-010, S-080, S-089
- grade: SUPPORTED
- scope and context: human smoking versus machine measurement.
- permitted inference: machine-measured lower tar/nicotine does not mean the smoker took less; compensation is the designed human response to a nicotine-seeking dose.
- prohibited inference: every smoker compensates identically, or that unventilated cigarettes are a harm-reduction recommendation.
- empirical limit: human smoking vs FTC-style machines; not identical compensation for every smoker.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-10 — NRT trial odds vs actual attempts
- finding: licensed NRT raises trial abstinence vs control, while most real attempts are unassisted with low single-attempt success.
- reader line: licensed NRT vs control raises 6+ month abstinence (pooled RR 1.55); most smokers who try to quit do so unassisted, with unaided success around 7–8%.
- unit: SEU-004
- sources: S-077, S-078
- grade: CONTESTED as a single slogan; both component facts SUPPORTED in their own scopes
- scope and context: motivated trial quitters versus population attempts; different questions.
- permitted inference: NRT can raise odds versus placebo in trials; most attempts are still unmedicated; neither fact means the reader cannot quit, and neither fact is a prescription.
- prohibited inference: "you cannot quit without patches" or "cold turkey never works." The two statistics answer different questions and must not be collapsed.
- empirical limit: motivated trial quitters, not all smokers; population attempts, not lifetime; not a guarantee and not proof nobody quits without help.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-11 — withdrawal short peak
- finding: withdrawal restlessness with short typical peak then easing.
- reader line: withdrawal symptoms typically peak in the first few days and usually subside within a few weeks; they may begin within hours; MedlinePlus places the sharpest edge about 2–3 days after last use.
- unit: SEU-005
- sources: S-009, S-081
- grade: SUPPORTED (population typical, not every reader)
- scope and context: day two or three without cigarette, irritability and craving.
- permitted inference: the restless empty feeling is withdrawal pharmacology with a short typical peak, not proof the cigarette was the real self.
- prohibited inference: withdrawal is weeks of physical torture for everyone, or that it is harmless for every person in every circumstance.
- empirical limit: population typical, not every reader; dependent users vary; genetics influence severity; does not negate rare complications.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

> If you live with a medical condition, take prescribed medication, feel ill, feel severe distress, or worry about stopping, speak to a clinician for personal care. This book changes what you believe smoking gives you; it does not give medical advice and does not ask you to ignore a doctor.

Architecture: 14 chapters. C01 contract and hook. C02 trap first seen with creatures in passing and body encounters. C03 axis switch. C04–C07 demolitions and mechanism deepening on installed ground. C08 inhabit ordinary doing. C09 widen indictment plus fear. C10 strongest case plus embedded testimony. C11 escape routes plus myths battery and meta-inoculation. C12 last ordinary instance and vow. C13 ordinary life with owned thoughts once. C14 short photographable recap and outward push.

Chapter 13
THE KETTLE, THE QUEUE AND THE NIGHT

*The kettle still boils, the shop still opens and the evening still comes, and all of them are yours with nothing burned out of the middle.*

### The Cup You Already Own

Feet finding the cold lino while the kettle clicks is still a morning, and yours now has no second job hidden inside it.

You wake. The room is the same room. The light at the curtain is the same light. The kettle is where you left it last night. You fill it, you switch it on, and you stand while it warms. No patting of pockets before you stand. No counting in the box to see if there are enough to get you to the shops. No lighting with the window cracked while the water boils behind you.

I stood on that same lino for years with paper between the knuckles. I know the shuffle, the cough to earn the day, the coffee rinsed through sour. We all lived that shuffle. You do not live it this morning.

So watch what the minutes do when nothing is timetabling them.

The kettle clicks off. You pour. The steam lifts off the cup and touches your face. You hold the cup with both hands. The hands lie still round the warmth. They do not tap, they do not hunt, they do not shield anything from wind. They hold. That stillness is not something you have to learn. It is what hands do when they are not employed as holders.

You take the cup to the window. You open the crack a finger's width. Cold morning air comes in. You drink. The first sip tastes of what is in the cup. The second sip tastes of what is in the cup. The tongue is clear from sleep and it stays clear. Toast goes in. Butter melts into the holes. You taste bread, salt, butter. You chew to the crust and the taste stays to the end. For years the edges shortened under sour. This morning nothing shortens.

Notice how long the morning is when no ten minutes are burned out of it. You wash the cup. Hot water, cloth, upturn on the drainer. You wipe the crumbs into your palm and tip them in the bin. You wipe the counter. These are small jobs and they take a minute, and the minute is whole. No hand reaches for the tray while the other wipes. No thought of stepping out to the step while the toast cools. The toast does not cool while you are gone, because you are not gone.

You dress. Keys, phone, coins. The pocket holds what a pocket should hold. You feel the soft weight of coins for milk and bread and nothing else rattling beside them. You pull the door. The hall smells of soap and toast. The coat smells of cupboard and rain from yesterday. It does not smell of last night's doorway.

Walk to work, to the bus, to the car. The pavement is damp. Bins are out. Somebody's kitchen fan hums. You breathe through the nose and the air goes all the way down without catching. You do not cough to clear a path for it. The chest does not ask for anything first.

That is the morning. Not a test. Not a proof. Just kettle, cup, window, toast, door. The things that were always there, with the paper taken out of the middle so you can see them edge to edge.

### The Queue At The Till

You step in for milk on the way home. The bell over the door pings. The strip light hums. The queue shuffles forward in coats.

The shelf behind the till glows with printed boxes in a row. You see them because they are there. The person ahead asks for his brand. The assistant turns, slides the box across, takes the coins. The plastic wrap crackles. You smell the faint stale sweetness off his coat as he passes to the door. You remember wearing that smell. We all wore it.

You stand with your milk in your hands. The carton is cold through your fingers. Your pocket holds keys, phone, coins. Nothing else rides beside them. No box soft at the corners. No timetable ticking toward the next doorway.

Pay. Take your change. Feel the coins warm in the palm for a second before they go back in the pocket. Walk out with open hands. The bell pings behind you.

Notice how short the errand is when no second errand hides inside it. In the old days the shop was never just the shop. It was the shop plus the check: will this box last the evening, will I need to come back in rain, where will I stand to blunt the walk home. We did arithmetic at every till. You do no arithmetic now. Milk, bread, change, door. The pavement outside is the same pavement. The walk home leaves toothpaste and cold air in the mouth, and nothing sour underneath.

I did that walk for years with the first one lit outside the door. First pull to take the edge off the sour the last one left. We called the edge fresh air and blamed the street. You walk it now with nothing lit and nothing blunted, and the street is only the street: traffic, wet leaves, somebody's chips, rain coming on.

Put the milk in the fridge. Put the bread in the bin. Put the coins in the dish by the door. The kitchen is as you left it this morning. Cup upturned, counter wiped. No tray to move aside before you can chop. No ash dusting the rim of anything.

That is the shop. It sells what it sells. It does not sell you an evening.

### The Pause That Stays Yours

Mid-morning the screen blurs. Mid-afternoon the phone goes down hard. Shoulders up round the ears. Head full.

You stand. You stretch. Arms up, neck rolled, back cracked. You walk to the doorway with a cup or with nothing at all.

Cold air on the face. The street sounds go on. Traffic, pigeons on the wire, the shutters of the shop across the road half down. You lean on the frame. You watch the light change on the brick opposite. You drink the tea tasting of tea. You do nothing for ten minutes that needs a name.

I took these pauses for years with paper and without, and I tell you what stayed. What made the pause sweet was standing, moving, looking away, letting the head clear while the body breathed. The papers sat inside exactly where you left them, whether you burned something in the doorway or not.

So keep the pause and let paper stay out of it. Go back in when you are ready. Sit. Meet the papers with hands that can type, lift, hold. The head is clearer because you stood and looked away, not because anything was lit. The shoulders drop because you rolled them on the way to the door.

We all called that doorway a break and thought the break had two parts: legs plus light. It had one part. Legs. Air. Looking away. The light only hired out the ten minutes and charged you the next fifty wanting the next hire.

Your ten minutes now are not hired. They are yours from edge to edge. You spend them watching clouds cross an aerial, hearing the kettle in the office kitchen click off, feeling the cup warm your palms. Then you spend the next hour on the work itself, with no eye on the clock for when you can step out again. The clock is only the clock. It tells you when lunch is, when the post comes. It does not tell you when you may breathe.

### Supper And The Phone

Evening comes the way it always came. Bag down. Coat off. Fridge open. Light on over the cooker.

You chop. Onion, pepper, garlic. The board thumps under the knife. Oil heats and spits. You stir and the steam lifts pepper into your nose and makes you sneeze once. You laugh at yourself. You taste the sauce off the spoon. Salt. Heat. Tomato. You add a pinch more salt and taste again. The taste is there from the first lick to the swallow, with no fur on the tongue to rinse through.

For years supper had a frame round it. One before to mark the end of work. One after to mark the plate done. We stood at the back door while the pan cooled and the sauce skinned, blowing thin smoke into dark while the food waited and dulled. We called those the meal ones and said they rounded the food. They only interrupted it and taxed the taste at both ends.

Tonight there is no frame. There is the pan, the spoon, the plate. You carry the plate to the table. You sit. You eat while it is hot. You hear the fork on the plate. You mop the last of the sauce with bread and the bread tastes of bread and sauce to the last bite. You push the plate away and the taste stays clean behind it.

The phone rings. It is the old hour for the old call: mate, brother, mother, the voice that used to mean stepping out with the cordless to the yard while the plate sat and the voice half-listened through pulls.

You answer at the table. You stay at the table. You talk with the plate pushed aside and the cup in reach.

“How are you doing then?”

You tell him about the day. The bus late. The queue. The sauce you just made. You listen about his boiler, his kid's teeth, the match on Saturday. The call lasts twenty minutes. Your end of it is all there. No stepping out mid-sentence to stand in rain. No holding the phone with the shoulder while the other hand cups and shields. No coming back in with the thread of the talk lost and asking him to say it again.

I know those yard calls. We all made them. Half an ear on the voice, half an ear listening for the pull to finish, coming back in with cold fingers and a sour mouth and pretending we had heard. Tonight you hear. Tonight you are where the voice thinks you are: at the table, unhurried, with nowhere to get to before the call ends.

When you hang up, the kitchen is still warm from the cooker. The plate waits to be washed. Nothing else waits. No box to check. No last one before bed to fit in. The evening has not been divided into before and after. It has run straight through, pan to plate to phone, and there is still hours of it left to spend as you choose.

Wash the plate. Hot water, brush, rack. Wipe the board. Put the knife back in the block. Put the leftovers in a tub for tomorrow. These are evening jobs and they close the meal the way a lid closes a pan. No tray to empty. No window to open wide to clear the room before sleep. The room smells of garlic and washing-up liquid. That is what a kitchen smells of after supper when nothing has been burned in it.

### The Evening Stretch

Seven to ten used to be timetabled. We knew the timetable by heart. One after supper. One with the programme. One in the adverts. One before bed to see us through the night. We watched the clock more than the screen, shifting in the chair as the hour hand moved, timing the trip to the door so we would not miss the turn.

Tonight the clock is only furniture.

You sit. The programme comes on. You watch it all the way through. Nobody pauses you from inside. Nobody leans you toward the door in the adverts. The adverts come and go and you get up for water because you want water, not because water is an excuse to stand where paper can be lit.

Notice the chair. You sit in it differently. Not perched on the edge ready to rise. Not twisted to keep one eye on the pocket. You sit back. Feet up. Cup at the elbow. Hands empty in the lap or round the cup. For years those hands performed a hundred small jobs in an evening: patting, flicking, shielding, hunting trays, holding mints, spraying coats before bed. Watch how quiet they are now. They lie still. They do not miss the work.

The phone buzzes. A laugh across a patio table with glasses sweating is planned for Saturday, and someone asks who is coming. You type back with both thumbs. Coming. No small calculation about where you will stand over there, whether you will need to bring enough, whether you will have to slip away mid-laugh. You will sit at the table for as long as the laugh lasts, and get up when the laugh is done.

That is all that thought needs tonight. It comes, it is answered, it passes.

Later you walk to the window before bed. Open it a crack. Smell the night. Rain, bins, cold stone. For years the window was a place to blow smoke through while listening for footsteps in the hall. Now it is a place to breathe through. The difference is not small in the living, though it takes only a second to do: mouth empty, chest open, night coming in clean.

You lock the window. You turn the latch on the door. You turn off the front room light. The house ticks as houses tick when the heating cools. No last check of the box by the bed. No glass of water put out to rinse a morning mouth that you already know will be sour. The morning mouth will be clear because the night mouth is clear.

This is what untimed time feels like from the inside. Not grand. Not loud. Just uncut. An evening that runs from supper to bed without being sliced into hourly hires is longer than you remember evenings being. You get to the end of the programme and there is still time to read ten pages. You read ten pages and there is still time to stand at the window. You stand at the window and there is still time to write the list for tomorrow. The hours have not stretched. They have stopped being taxed.

### Bed And The Next Light

Teeth. Face. Socks off. Light off.

The bed is cold at the edges and warm in the middle where you lie. The pillow smells of pillow. The mouth tastes of toothpaste and nothing underneath. For years the last taste before sleep was sour under mint, and the first thought on waking was where the box sat. We slept with a timetable beside the bed and called it habit.

You lie now with nothing beside the bed but water and the alarm. The body settles. Shoulders, hips, jaw. The day runs back through the head without being searched for gaps: kettle, bus, queue, doorway, pan, phone, programme, window. Every room in the day was occupied all the way through. Nothing was stepped out of. That is why the day feels longer in memory and shorter in the living. You were in it throughout.

Sleep comes the way sleep comes when nothing is asking. Breath slows. Thoughts thin. The street goes quiet outside and then louder once as a car passes and then quiet again. You turn on the side. The hands rest open on the sheet. They do not reach in sleep. They have nothing to reach for.

Morning comes. Alarm. Light at the curtain a shade paler than yesterday. Feet to the lino. Kettle on.

This is the second kettle, and it proves what the first one showed. Tongue clear from sleep. Cup in open hands. Toast tasting of toast to the crust. Pocket with keys, phone, coins. Door pulled with the hall smelling of soap. No cough to earn the day. No hunt before the water boils.

I tell you this because you lived it once yesterday and might still wonder if yesterday was luck. It was not luck. It is what mornings do when no paper comes before them. The body wakes the way it woke before the first tube you ever lit: thirsty for water, hungry for food, glad of light. That gladness was never made by leaf. Leaf only borrowed it and charged you for the loan.

So live the second morning the way you lived the first. Pour, hold, drink, eat, wash, dress, go. The shop will open when you pass it. The doorway at work will be there when you need air. Supper will wait in the fridge as leftovers in a tub. The phone may ring at the table again. The evening will run uncut again. The bed will be cold at the edges and warm in the middle again.

Day after day after day. Not counted. Not measured toward some distant point where you will finally be something. You are something now, and the days only show it more plainly as they pass.

### When The Thought Lights Up

It will happen. A faint hollow taps after the kettle clicks and says, hold something. A hand extends a pack on Saturday and the old line floats over: go on, one will not hurt.

Hear both with clear eyes. Neither is you reasoning. Both are the old script talking, pre-labelled.

We all heard that script for years and mistook it for our own voice. We said the stick seasoned the night, paid the finished paragraph, steadied the hand after the row. The night was sun, leisure, company. The paragraph was work done well. The row was still there after the ash fell. The tube was only ever sneaking a ride on kettle, food, pause, company, night air. The kettle, the food, the pause, the company, the night air remain. The rider is gone.

When the thought crosses your mind now, do not argue with it and do not try to not think it. Let it come, name it for what it is, and answer it with the shout that turns the old tap into proof.

YIPPEE! I'M FREE!

Say it at the table and feel how true it is. Mean it from the belly. Say it when you watch smokers huddle outside a doorway and feel pity, not envy — they are still timed, still soured, still divided between daylight talk and yard habit. You are not missing. They are.

That shout is yours to keep. The thought arrives, the shout answers, the moment proves itself whole.

Stand now. Wash the cup. Lift your head. Walk into the next ordinary hour with empty hands, clear tongue and a pocket with no timetable in it. Supper, phone, bed, next light — all yours, all whole, all lived through to the edge.

**SUMMARY**
- Morning coffee and toast stay whole to the crust when no paper comes before them, and the cup is washed without stepping away.
- The shop is only a shop, and the walk home leaves no sour underneath when no box rides in the pocket.
- The work pause clears the head by standing and breathing, and the papers are met with hands ready for work.
- Supper is eaten hot to the last bite, and the phone call at the table is heard all the way through with nowhere else to get to.
- Evening runs uncut from programme to window to bed, and the hours are longer because nothing is taxed out of them.
- Sleep comes with toothpaste clear in the mouth, and the next kettle boils the same as the last, with the same clear tongue and quiet hands.
- A faint tap or an offered pack is the old script talking, and it is answered with a shout of joy that smoking is over.
