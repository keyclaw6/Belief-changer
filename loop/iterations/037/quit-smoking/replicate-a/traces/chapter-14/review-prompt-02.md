You are the book factory chapter-reviewer, a fresh isolated role call.

Follow this contract exactly:

# Chapter reviewer

You are a factory component, not a judge. You never see a reference book
or any judge prompt. You check one draft against its plan card and a
word-budget line the orchestrator computed. Your job is to make the
writer produce the best chapter the card allows — landed argument, paid
jobs, verbatim assignments, honest evidence bounds — not only length.

## Inputs (exactly these)

1. The accepted master plan
2. This chapter's card
3. The draft chapter
4. One line: `Delivered N words. Budget B.`

## Output

Start with exactly `ACCEPT` or `REVISE`.

Then at most 7 findings. Each finding is one of:

- `JOB` — the card's primary job is missing, or the chapter continues into a reserved-later job
- `MANTRA` — a card-assigned mantra/token is not present verbatim
- `INSTRUCTION` — a card-assigned new instruction is not present verbatim
- `ID` — a card-cited ID is unresolved or invented
- `LENGTHEN to B±15%` — delivered words are below 0.85 × B
- `SHORTEN to B±15%` — delivered words are above 1.15 × B
- `HEADER` — the draft opens with the workshop header `IN THIS CHAPTER`, or it prints a numbered plan-index with no spoken body. A numbered ALL-CAPS instruction plus one spoken rationale line is not `HEADER`.
- `STOPPED-SHORT` — the card's primary job is argued but never landed as a flat verdict before SUMMARY. The reader can still hold the entering belief. Quote the missing landing.
- `UNASSIGNED-REFRAIN` — a non-mantra phrase recurs ≥3× verbatim. Name the phrase and the count. Subtract repeats; do not invent a new mantra.
- `RESERVED-REACH` — the draft performs a later chapter's primary job. Name that later card and cut the overreach to at most one sentence.
- `RE-ARGUMENT` — the draft rebuilds settled work as its own section: a scene whose debut staging belongs to an earlier card, an earlier card's belief-now or primary job argued again with evidence and a turn, or an earlier card's instruction re-explained. Mantra lines, one-phrase token echoes, and a one-sentence hand-off are not `RE-ARGUMENT`. Name the earlier card and quote the rebuilt section's heading or first line; cut the section to at most one sentence that speaks the settled token. If that cut leaves the chapter below 0.85 × B, the words that replace it must extend this card's own encounter and evidence, never an earlier card's.
- `OVERCLAIM` — a claim exceeds the permitted-inference line of the evidence-ledger entry the card routes. Quote the overclaim and the bound. The writer must speak the bound; never print the ledger ID or grade in prose.

No other finding types. No style notes. No "sounds like AI." No comparison
to any other book. No warmth, tone, or voice coaching.

`ACCEPT` only when every check above is fine (length inside ±15% of B, job
done and stopped and landed, assigned mantras/instructions verbatim, IDs
resolved, no `HEADER`, no unassigned refrain, no reserved-later job, no
re-argument, no overclaim).

`REVISE` when any check fails. List the findings. Be specific: quote the
missing job, the missing wording, or the overclaim.

## Rules

- Do not rewrite the chapter yourself.
- Do not invent a word budget. Use B from the orchestrator line.
- Do not ask for another review round. The orchestrator decides whether
  there is another rewrite (up to three).
- When you demand more words, make the LENGTHEN finding an expansion assignment, not merely a quotation of the card's job: identify a specific unfinished encounter, unanswered objection, or undeveloped consequence belonging to this card, quote the draft location to extend, and state what new understanding or lived consequence that extension must deliver. Check that target against earlier cards and against conclusions already landed in this draft; neither an earlier proof in a new setting nor another proof of the same landed conclusion is a valid expansion target. For an ordinary-life card, extend what happens next with the settled understanding already assumed, not how that understanding is proved again. If you cannot identify an unspent target supported by the card and plan, report that limitation within LENGTHEN rather than inventing evidence or requesting generic additional examples; retain the computed budget and the existing ACCEPT requirements.
- Your entire reply IS the review.

Delivered 3767 words. Budget 5000.

# Master Plan — Quit Smoking
`production-books/quit-smoking/master-plan.md`

## 1. Book Core

- target behavior: compulsive cigarette smoking. Total stop at a last cigarette, then none. Not cutting down, not vaping as destination, not NRT as method.
- reader state: an adult daily smoker, years inside the trap, smoking to get through stress, breaks, meals and nights out, failed by willpower, patches or cold turkey, privately sure life without cigarettes would be flat or impossible yet lighting the next one within the hour.
- load-bearing false belief, frozen: Cigarettes relax me, help me cope and are my pleasure, and life without them would mean deprivation.
- through-line: every cigarette never gave, only took; seeing the taking clearly makes stopping an escape into clean air, not a sacrifice of a friend.
- format: full-length belief-changer, 14 chapters, about 60,000 words, last cigarette ritual then ordinary life then short recap.
- Fork 1 — inner monster: full Carr personification. The trivial physical creature to starve is the Nipper, M-D. The belief-system that feeds it is the Smokescreen, M-E. Craving is external, small, already dying; the belief is the real target.
- Fork 2 — outcome: total cessation, commanded with cheerful certainty. Moderation foreclosed by pincer and cliff logic. No autonomy to keep smoking safely.
- Fork 3 — science weight: Carr's own position. Nicotine pharmacology and industry documents delivered flat and frightening where true, then disowned as motive; change from escape-joy, not fear. No literature-review texture. Honour limits by not overclaiming.
- Fork 4 — villain: two villains hit hard. The nicotine trap and industry that built it, and the Willpower Method that kept the reader in it. Warm to the person, vicious to the trap and the wrong method.
- Fork 5 — void: natural baseline. Change nothing else in life. The non-smoker body returns to breathing, tasting and calm attention on its own. No replacement ritual as method.
- redefinition / margin: none. Smoking is not split into a Good-X / Bad-X line; no CAPS redefinition, no dose buffer. A slip is a rumble strip for belief, never a licensed puff; guard the belief, not the behaviour with a margin.
- safety perimeter: routed to CA-SAFE. No medical advice, no instruction to ignore a doctor, crisis or illness pointers only, last-cigarette ritual ceremonial not a dare to smoke more.
- strongest pro-behaviour scene: SC-A, late-night patio with friends and drinks, offered cigarette, one won't hurt.
- destination state: whenever the reader thinks of a cigarette they feel relief and freedom that they no longer smoke, happy to be free from day one.
- saved ending reframe, appears only in C14: the ashtray was already empty — you were the one who kept refilling it, and now you have put the habit down like a borrowed coat that was never yours.
- method fidelity: escape not sacrifice, warm to person and vicious to trap, no willpower, fear raised at full force then disowned by escape where assigned, immediate freedom after belief change, original prose, Fork-1 personification throughout.

## 2. Compact Evidence Ledger

E-01 — lived off-switch
- finding: smoker credits rapid taken-care-of feeling to cigarette after stress.
- reader line, exact: "If anything stressful happens in my life, a cigarette takes care of it."
- unit: LEU-001
- source: S-001
- grade: lived account — n/a, no clinical grade
- scope and context: adult smoker, stressful moment, hand already reaching.
- permitted inference: the smoker experiences a rapid "taken care of" feeling and credits the cigarette; the same writer can know the credit is false and still feel the relief.
- prohibited inference: that cigarettes treat the underlying problem, or that stress without a cigarette is medically dangerous.
- empirical limit: single-situation account; does not establish mechanism or prevalence beyond described encounter.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-02 — lived social offer
- finding: night-out scene plus drinking collapses social-smoker rule into exception.
- reader line, exact: "You often get offered a cigarette and in that kind of environment it's hard to turn down. You don't want to be the only one not smoking and because you've been drinking, you don't think about the risks, you think one won't hurt."
- unit: LEU-002
- source: S-051
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: night out, smoking area, friends lighting up, alcohol on board.
- permitted inference: the social scene plus drinking is named as the moment the "social smoker" rule collapses into "one won't hurt."
- prohibited inference: that the reader must avoid all friends or all alcohol as the method of quitting.
- empirical limit: single-situation account; does not prescribe social avoidance.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-03 — lived twenty attempts
- finding: years of replacements and willpower attempts with expected failure.
- reader line, exact: "I had probably attempted at least twenty times before and used most of the replacements and meds on the market with no success."
- unit: LEU-003
- source: S-006
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: failed-quitter history, patches, gum, cold turkey.
- permitted inference: repeated failed attempts with replacements and willpower are typical in this community, not proof the reader is uniquely weak.
- prohibited inference: that nobody ever quits, or that replacements must be used, or that they must never be used.
- empirical limit: community typicality as described; not a trial efficacy claim.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-04 — lived heaven then shame
- finding: lighting-up called heaven, aftertaste shame, unwilling to give up lighting.
- reader line, exact: "the moment I light up I'm in heaven, but feel shitty afterwards. So whilst I love smoking I hate being a smoker"
- unit: LEU-004
- source: S-013
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: moment of lighting, then aftertaste.
- permitted inference: "I enjoy it" can coexist with hating the identity of being a smoker; enjoyment is named at the moment of lighting, not as a day-long gift.
- prohibited inference: that the reader is lying about enjoyment, or that enjoyment must be mocked.
- empirical limit: moment-specific account; not a day-long benefit proof.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-05 — lived reward for everything
- finding: cigarette attached as payment to almost any finished act.
- reader line, exact: "Cigarettes were my reward for…well, almost everything. Teaching a class. Finishing a story. Finishing a paragraph. Driving 500 miles. Driving to the grocery store."
- unit: LEU-005
- source: S-045
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: work finish, drive, errand, day structured as pellets.
- permitted inference: the "reward" can attach to almost any completed act; the party is the cigarette, not the work.
- prohibited inference: that work or driving requires nicotine, or that quitting means life has no celebrations.
- empirical limit: single-pattern account; does not prove work needs nicotine.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-06 — lived just one after months
- finding: long quit undone by moderate-voice offer of one.
- reader line, exact: "I know I can never have just one. I learned that the hard way, thinking after 5 months I could control myself and just have one. Nope."
- unit: LEU-006
- source: S-006
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: five months smoke-free, control illusion, chain back.
- permitted inference: a long quit does not make "just one" safe; the smoker who learned this the hard way names it as never.
- prohibited inference: that a slip dooms the reader forever if the belief is not let back in; no dare to test "just one."
- empirical limit: single-case warning; not a doom sentence if belief is guarded.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-07 — ten-second hit and rapid fade
- finding: smoked nicotine peaks in brain within seconds, acute effects dissipate quickly, driving redosing.
- reader line, exact: "When cigarette smoke enters the lungs, nicotine is absorbed rapidly in the blood and delivered quickly to the brain, so that nicotine levels peak within 10 seconds of inhalation. But the acute effects of nicotine also dissipate quickly, along with the associated feelings of reward; this rapid cycle causes the smoker to continue dosing to maintain the drug's pleasurable effects and prevent withdrawal symptoms."
- unit: SEU-001
- source: S-009
- grade: SUPPORTED
- scope and context: smoked nicotine pharmacokinetics, puff timing.
- permitted inference: the "relief" is replenishment of a rapidly fading dose, not a gift that solves the original stress.
- prohibited inference: every puff is a unique pleasure; "you cannot quit."
- empirical limit: smoked nicotine pharmacokinetics; describes typical cycle, not every puff as unique pleasure.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-08 — product is nicotine
- finding: internal industry definition of cigarette as nicotine package.
- reader line, exact: "The cigarette should be conceived not as a product but as a package. the product is nicotine."
- unit: SEU-002
- source: S-091
- grade: SUPPORTED (historical industry document)
- scope and context: manufacturer layer view, pack and puff as dispenser.
- permitted inference: an industry scientist defined the cigarette as a nicotine package and dispenser, not as a flavour accessory.
- prohibited inference: quoting an internal memo as if it were a public-health consensus paper, or as a dare to smoke more to "see the product."
- empirical limit: internal research planning memo, not a consumer brochure or clinical trial.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-09 — lights do not cut dose
- finding: ventilated light cigarettes do not reduce human intake; compensation with bigger puffs.
- reader line: ventilated/"light" cigarettes do not reduce human intake; smokers compensate with bigger puffs.
- unit: SEU-003
- sources: S-010, S-080, S-089
- grade: SUPPORTED
- scope and context: human smoking versus machine measurement.
- permitted inference: machine-measured lower tar/nicotine does not mean the smoker took less; compensation is the designed human response to a nicotine-seeking dose.
- prohibited inference: every smoker compensates identically, or that unventilated cigarettes are a harm-reduction recommendation.
- empirical limit: human smoking vs FTC-style machines; not identical compensation for every smoker.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-10 — NRT trial odds vs actual attempts
- finding: licensed NRT raises trial abstinence vs control, while most real attempts are unassisted with low single-attempt success.
- reader line: licensed NRT vs control raises 6+ month abstinence (pooled RR 1.55); most smokers who try to quit do so unassisted, with unaided success around 7–8%.
- unit: SEU-004
- sources: S-077, S-078
- grade: CONTESTED as a single slogan; both component facts SUPPORTED in their own scopes
- scope and context: motivated trial quitters versus population attempts; different questions.
- permitted inference: NRT can raise odds versus placebo in trials; most attempts are still unmedicated; neither fact means the reader cannot quit, and neither fact is a prescription.
- prohibited inference: "you cannot quit without patches" or "cold turkey never works." The two statistics answer different questions and must not be collapsed.
- empirical limit: motivated trial quitters, not all smokers; population attempts, not lifetime; not a guarantee and not proof nobody quits without help.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-11 — withdrawal short peak
- finding: withdrawal restlessness with short typical peak then easing.
- reader line: withdrawal symptoms typically peak in the first few days and usually subside within a few weeks; they may begin within hours; MedlinePlus places the sharpest edge about 2–3 days after last use.
- unit: SEU-005
- sources: S-009, S-081
- grade: SUPPORTED (population typical, not every reader)
- scope and context: day two or three without cigarette, irritability and craving.
- permitted inference: the restless empty feeling is withdrawal pharmacology with a short typical peak, not proof the cigarette was the real self.
- prohibited inference: withdrawal is weeks of physical torture for everyone, or that it is harmless for every person in every circumstance.
- empirical limit: population typical, not every reader; dependent users vary; genetics influence severity; does not negate rare complications.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

## 6. Arc and Length

Architecture: 14 chapters. C01 contract and hook. C02 trap first seen with creatures in passing and body encounters. C03 axis switch. C04–C07 demolitions and mechanism deepening on installed ground. C08 inhabit ordinary doing. C09 widen indictment plus fear. C10 strongest case plus embedded testimony. C11 escape routes plus myths battery and meta-inoculation. C12 last ordinary instance and vow. C13 ordinary life with owned thoughts once. C14 short photographable recap and outward push.

- concept debuts: contract C01; trap and creatures and sensory C02; TO/FOR C03; ease clause C04; off-switch kill C04; reward and lights kill C05; anti-method C06; inversion deepening C07; inhabit C08; villain dossier and tug-of-war and cost triple C09; strongest case C10; just-one and myths C11; terminal mantra and vow C12; ordinary life C13; ending reframe C14 only.
- demolition curve: low C01, rising C03–C05, peak C06–C11, handing to freedom after C12.
- freedom crescendo: promise C01, suppressed C04–C09 to let demolition work, rising C10–C11, detonated C12–C14 with more freedom language than rest combined.
- structural responsibilities: long testimony in main flow C10; myths Q&A distinct room C11; meta-inoculation C11; inhabit C08; last ordinary instance C12; ordinary life C13; short recap C14; no mid-book recap; prevalence claim once C06 via E-03 typicality.

Chapter 14
FREE FOR GOOD

*There was never anything to miss, because nothing was ever given.*

### THE ASHTRAY WAS ALREADY EMPTY

Look at the ashtray this morning.

We kept it full for years. We tapped and lit and tapped again, and told ourselves the fullness meant something was there for us. I stood at that same glass for years, counting stubs like proof of company. I tell you now because I lived it: the ashtray was already empty — you were the one who kept refilling it, and now you have put the habit down like a borrowed coat that was never yours.

That is what the last days have shown. You left the nicotine trap when you saw it plain. You stopped feeding the Nipper its tiny dose. You watched the Smokescreen thin and clear until only habit-talk was left.

Ask from your own Tuesdays, not from old fear. When did a dose ever mend the argument? Did it settle the bill on the desk? Did it quiet the phone or soften the news? Or did it leave every paper exactly where it lay while it hired your hands for five minutes?

It does plenty TO you. It does nothing FOR you.

We believed paper calmed, rewarded, and held company. We lit at the desk, at the table, at the door, and credited the stick for what the pause, the meal, the talk had done. It never fixed the itch. It caused it.

“Just one. One won’t hurt.”

You know that line now. You heard it on bright patios and on hard afternoons, and you know whose mouth it comes from. A dose taken to test the seeing only rebuilds the bottle. A mind that keeps no exception has no quarrel left to lose.

Think of that farewell table where you smoked the last one with full attention on stain and ash and stale end. No pleasure asked to be mourned there. Only a con laid down.

Stand at the sink and rinse that glass. The water runs hot then clear. The stubs are gone. The smear at the rim lifts with one wipe of the cloth. Hold the clean glass to the light. That is not a symbol. It is glass. For years we read meaning into ash because we were told to. The meaning was hired. The glass holds nothing and asks for nothing. Leave it on the drainer upside down. Hear the small clink. That clink is the whole sound of what was kept.

I emptied mine on a wet Tuesday with rain on the sill. I did not dress it up. I did not make a speech. I tipped, rinsed, wiped, set down. The hand that had lifted paper a thousand times lifted glass once and put it back clean. The shoulder did not ache for what was gone. The eye did not follow what was tipped away. What was tipped away was not company. It was rent paid for interruptions.

Look at the table under it. Wood, ring-marked, wiped. The cloth leaves a damp trail that dries as you watch. The window above shows yard and sky without a veil. The curtain does not move to let anything out. The drawer does not hold foil and mint to cover anything. The room smells of soap and toast and rain. Keep that smell. It was always there under the cover.

We told ourselves the full ashtray proved the days were full. The days were full despite it. The work got done between exits. The talk went on when we came back. The meal sat cooling while we stood outside. The fullness in the glass was not fullness in the life. It was the count of times attention was hired away.

Count now the other way. Count the table staying clear through breakfast. Count the sill staying clean through rain. Count the drawer staying shut because nothing in it is needed. Count the bin without fresh stubs at night. That count adds without effort because nothing is being added. Empty stays empty when nothing is put back.

Put your palm flat on the table where the glass stood. Wood cool under skin. No heat, no grit, no sour edge. That cool is the whole fact. Paper promised warmth and gave a burn to tend. The table gives cool without asking for tending. Rest the hand there a second longer. This is what hands do when they are not hired: they rest, they feel, they lift what needs lifting and put it down.

You will pass that table a hundred times. Each pass will say the same without words. Nothing here needs refilling. The coat on the hook by the door was never cut for you. It hung heavy, smelled of other rooms, pulled at the shoulders. You wore it because it was put on you early and you were told the weather required it. You have taken it off and hung it back on its nail. Your own shoulders stand straight in your own shirt. The air on the arms is plain and sufficient.

### WHAT YOU KEEP FOR GOOD

You keep no rules to carry like stones. You keep seeing.

When old doubt taps, you answer plain: you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

What was done at that table was done easily, immediately and permanently.

You know the place left behind. The trap held both ends of every worry, and the tug you once called need was only an empty, slightly restless, slightly edgy little tug unfed for a minute and then gone. And the tug-of-war of fear is over because neither rope is in its hands now.

That stale, breathless and chained state was not your nature. It was the daily rent of doses.

I have walked the same errands you walked this week — kettle, queue, doorway, sofa — with hands open and mind present, and found nothing missing. You have walked them too. That lived proof is the whole keeping now.

All you have to do is follow all the instructions.

Say them as true report, not as effort. When the flicker comes, name it hired talk and answer with what you own. Let the next task take the eyes. Kettle boiled. Bag carried. Talk heard to the end.

Keeping is not holding. Keeping is seeing kept. You do not hold the table clear by thinking about the table. You leave it clear by not putting back what never gave. You do not hold the pocket empty by patting it. You leave it empty by putting in it what belongs there: coins, keys, receipt, hand.

I keep a smooth stone from a beach on my sill. I did not buy it to replace anything. It was in my shoe after a walk and I set it down. Some days I turn it over. That is not method. That is a hand liking weight. Your keeping will be like that: small, unforced, uncounted. A glass rinsed. A drawer shut. A window left as it is.

When the mind tries to make keeping into work, ask from the table, not from the tug. Did the glass need polishing all day to stay clean? Did the coat need arguing off again once taken off? Or did clear stay clear because refilling stopped? You know. Clear stays clear.

### THE POCKET WHERE THE PACK USED TO SIT

Feel that pocket now.

We knew every pocket by weight. Left breast for box, right trouser for lighter, back for spare. The hand checked without orders. Patting, pressing, counting through cloth. In queues, in lifts, in talks, the fingers did their census. Full meant safe. Light meant hunt.

Put your hand in that pocket this morning. Coins. Keys. Folded receipt. Hand comes out with what went in. No census. No maths. The cloth hangs straight.

Keep the folded list where the box sat. Not as a charm. As paper that tells true. The box told you the day was secured. The paper tells you the day was never secured there. One lied with weight. The other tells with words.

I carried mine folded twice, soft at the edges after a month. Ink a little blurred where rain got in at the gate. I did not read it daily. I knew it was there. On a Tuesday when a lorry blocked the road and the phone rang twice and the old sentence started its flex in the fingers, I touched the fold through cloth and smiled. Not because paper saves, but because seeing saves and paper states seeing.

Fold it small enough to forget. That is the point. What is true does not need rehearsing. You do not rehearse your name. You do not rehearse the way home. You carry, and carrying is enough. When doubt taps — and it will tap, lightly, less and less — the answer is not a struggle. The answer is a sentence you already own.

You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Say it as a clerk marking a ledger true. Say easily, immediately and permanently as a date already entered, not a wish. Say the nicotine trap as the place left, not the place debated. Say the Nipper as the small unfed loop, not a voice to obey. Say the Smokescreen as cleared weather, not incoming cloud. Say an empty, slightly restless, slightly edgy little tug as a minute passing, not an order. Say the tug-of-war of fear as ropes dropped. Say stale, breathless and chained as rent ended. Say It does plenty TO you. It does nothing FOR you. as the one-line account. Say It never fixed the itch. It caused it. as the itch answer.

No second thesis here. No new proof. Only portable memory that holds without effort because it states what the table, the sink, the pocket already show.

Make the fold yours. Crease once across, once down. Slip it behind coins so it does not rub. Let the edges soften. Let ink fade a little. Faded true is still true. When you change coats, move it. Left breast to right side. Winter to spring. That small move is the whole transfer: seeing travels with the wearer, not with the season.

If someone asks what you carry, you need say nothing. This is not a flag. It is a receipt for goods never received and now no longer ordered. Keep it as quietly as you keep keys.

### THE POCKET LIST

Keep this folded where the pack used to sit. No callbacks. No adding. Photograph it with your eyes:

1. KEEP AN OPEN MIND
Give this book a fair hearing and it will free you.
2. DON'T STOP OR CUT DOWN YET
Smoke as normal until your last cigarette.
3. BEGIN BY FEELING GREAT TO BE ESCAPING
There is no doom here, only freedom ahead.
4. FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS
All you have to do is what this book asks.
5. IGNORE ANY ADVICE THAT CONFLICTS WITH THIS BOOK
Let this argument finish before you borrow another.
6. DISREGARD ANYONE WHO QUIT BY WILLPOWER
Their struggle was the method, not you.
7. REFUSE TO BE INFLUENCED BY OTHER SMOKERS
Watch them with clear eyes and keep your own judgment.
8. TRUST YOUR BODY TO BREATHE AND TASTE
Your body knows freedom without being taught.
9. SEE THE SELLER BEHIND THE SMOKE
Remember who built the trap and why.
10. MEET THE BEST CIGARETTE HEAD-ON
Let the favourite prove it gives nothing.
11. NEVER ALLOW JUST ONE OR A SPECIAL ONE
One keeps the trap alive.
12. SMOKE YOUR FINAL CIGARETTE AND KNOW YOU ARE FREE
Close the trap with joy, not sadness.

### THE WEEKS THAT PASS WITHOUT CEREMONY

Live the next weeks as weeks, not as tests.

Monday will bring its post and its bins. The diary will fill. A bill lands. A tyre goes soft. A child needs collecting at half past five in rain. None of this asks for commentary. Do the next piece. Open post with the knife from the drawer. Stack bill with bill. Ring the garage. Drive with both hands on the wheel at quarter to three and listen to the wipers. Collect at the gate with the engine ticking. These hours do not prove anything. They pass with attention whole because hiring stopped.

You will notice the pocket stays light on the school run. You will notice the car smells of upholstery and apples and wet wool, not of ash and spray. You will notice the dash holds no coins for the machine, no foil in the ash tray of the car. Wipe the wheel with your palm at the lights. Adjust the mirror with two fingers. Park straight between lines without hurrying to get out to stand somewhere else. Lock with the button. Hear the clunk. Walk to the gate with bag and coat and nothing else hired.

At work the roster turns. Cover for a colleague with a bad back. Take the late slot. Hand over with notes written clear. The drawer holds pens, tape, spare buttons, the folded list soft at the edge. Close the drawer with your hip while carrying files. Answer the phone with voice clear from the first word. Write the date without smudging. When the printer jams, open, lift, pull the sheet whole, close, press. Small completions stack. The pile on the left moves to the right. Initial, date, pass on.

Money will gather without a speech about money. We paid daily for the hiring. Now the coins stay. Put a jar on the shelf by the meter. Drop in what would have gone through the till. Do not count it as motive. Count it as weather: rain in a butt shows rain fell. The jar fills because outflow stopped. When it holds enough, spend on paint, on shoes that fit, on a train to see your sister. Spend without ceremony. The gain was never the coins. The coins are the bonus that follows seeing the way dust follows sweeping.

Evenings will shorten and lengthen. Dark at five, then light till nine. Pull curtains. Push them wide. The glass shows your room back to you, warm, whole, no orange tip moving in it. Wash up. Water hot. Plate, pan, mug. Set to drain. Wipe the board. Hang the cloth. Brush teeth. Taste mint sharp. Run tongue over clean gums kept clean. Lie down with hands open by sides. Breath comes and goes on its own because it always knew how.

A faint hollow may stir some nights, as if fingers and mouth should be busy. Do not scold it. It is only an old loop unfed. Let attention move back to pillow, blanket, breath. I have lain in that exact quiet and listened for panic and found none. There was only house tick and street passing and the plain fact that nothing was missing.

You will not count days. The calendar turns without marks. Cross off appointments, birthdays, boiler service, not tallies. If someone asks how long, you may have to work it out from the farewell table date. That forgetting is not carelessness. That forgetting is the sign that keeping is not work. What is not hired is not counted.

### THE MONTHS THAT SHOW WHAT EMPTY HOLDS

Let three months pass. Let six.

Spring will put buds on the hedge you pass to the shops. Summer will leave dust on the sill. Autumn will fill the gutter with leaves. Winter will ice the latch. Walk through all of it with the same pocket, the same fold, the same table staying clear. The seasons do the changing. You do the living.

Travel will come. A train south, a plane north, a car loaded to the roof with bags and pillows and a cool box. Pack with both hands. Tickets in the inside pocket with the list. Board, sit by the window, watch fields run. On the platform no stepping out to stand in a painted box. In the service station no timing the stop by burn-down. Buy tea. Drink it hot at the table while lorries move outside. Use both hands for cup and saucer. The announcement calls. Walk to the gate without leaving talk mid-sentence.

Take photographs. Not of instructions. Of people. Of hedges, dogs, plates, skies. Look later and see eyes present, not half-turned to doorways. That presence was always yours. Paper only borrowed it and called the loan a gift.

Work projects will rise and fall. A deadline, a move, an illness in the family, a birth. The phone will bring news that stops the room. Sit with it. Make tea. Hold the mug with both hands. Ring who needs ringing. Write what needs writing. Drive where driving is needed. The old voice may pass at such hours and say the moment requires hiring. Ask from the table, not from the tug. Which hour ever mended news? Which dose ever wrote the letter, drove the road, held the hand? You know. Hands held. Feet drove. Mind wrote. Hiring only cut time into stubs.

Friendship will adjust without speeches. Some will still step out. Stay inside with talk. Hear the story to the end. Laugh at the right place because you were there for the start. If someone presses a box toward you with laughter, meet the eyes, shake the head once, keep your hands round your mug. No lecture. No flag. Visible ease does its own quiet work. Those who ask later will ask because they saw steadiness, not because they were told.

I sat through such a night in November with rain on glass and a tray of lights going round. I watched hands lift, lips purse, smoke rise to the extractor. I watched the talk break as chairs scraped and reform thinner. I stayed with those who stayed, heard the end of a story about a lost dog found three streets off, laughed till tea came through the nose. Walking home under street lamps with coat buttoned, I touched the fold through cloth and grinned at nothing in particular. Not pride. Recognition. The night had given. Nothing had been hired.

Health will do what health does, day by day. Stairs taken whole. Mornings tasted. Food eaten to the end without stepping out between courses. These are not claims. They are hours. Live them and let them stack. The body does its own returning without lessons. Trust it as you trust sleep to come when lamps are out.

Money in the jar will have become paint on the hall, shoes worn in, a weekend by the sea with wind on the face and chips eaten hot from paper while gulls argue. Keep the jar. Start another for the next paint. This is not motive. This is weather showing.

### THE QUIET KEEPING WHEN DOUBT TAPS

Doubt will tap. Lightly. Rarely. Less.

It taps as a sentence in your own voice: things are hard, one would steady. It taps as a picture: lights low, talk warm, a hand extended. It taps as nostalgia: student days, first pay, dancing with ash on cuffs. Meet each as hired talk, not as thinking.

Ask from your own calendar, not from fear. Which hard hour was ever steadied by hiring? Which warm night ever needed it to be warm? Which student day is not better remembered for music and faces than for standing outside it? You have lived the answer in weeks without ceremony and months showing what empty holds.

So when the flicker comes, do not argue and do not follow. Name it for what it is and answer with true reporting in one loud inward line. Say it not to pump yourself up. Say it as a clerk marking a ledger true.

You grin from the chest and shout it silent: YIPPEE! I'M FREE!

Say it till the shoulders believe what the eyes already know, and get on with the next sentence of the day.

Teach no one unless asked. Do not carry the book like a flag. If a friend asks how, speak plain in your own words: nothing was given, so nothing is missed; the table stays clear because refilling stopped; the pocket holds a fold, not a box. Lend the seeing, not the struggle. Then talk of other things: work, weather, children, dogs, paint. Life is the subject now, not hiring.

If a slip ever touches — a puff taken in sleep-like habit at a wedding, ash tasted before mind caught up — do not make it a crash. Spit, rinse, put down. It does not prove the seeing false. It proves attention blinked. Re-read the fold. Rinse the glass. Empty stays empty from the next minute. No speech. No penance. The coat stays off because taking it off was seeing, not a streak unbroken.

Keep appointments with the clinician you already keep. If breath worries, if sleep breaks, if mood sinks past weather into weeks, speak to the doctor as you would for any health matter. This book changes what you believe hiring gave. It does not replace personal care. The farewell was a farewell, not a test. Treat the body as you treat the table: keep clear, wipe clean, call for mending when mending is needed.

Look ahead ten years. See the same table, the same sink, the same pocket, only older wood, deeper shine, softer fold. See hands that have carried bags, held newborns, turned pages, painted sills, dug soil, without once being hired mid-task. See a face in night glass with room warm behind it. That is not a dream. That is empty staying empty while life fills.

The borrowed coat hangs where you left it. It gathers dust. Moths find it. One day you will take it down to throw out and wonder how shoulders ever bore it. Fold, bag, bin. Close the lid. Wash hands. That throwing is not loss. It was never yours.

**SUMMARY**
- Each dose never calmed, rewarded, or held company; it only quieted for minutes a tug it had lit.
- The calm at the desk, the pause at work, the night with friends belonged to the hour and the people; paper only hired hands during them.
- The tug in the body is small and brief and already dying unfed; the belief that fed it is cleared.
- One never proves control; one only rebuilds the bottle, so no exception is kept.
- Ordinary days lived with kettle, queue, doorway, and sofa show the seeing true without new lessons.

Now get on with enjoying your life.

YIPPEE! I'M FREE!
