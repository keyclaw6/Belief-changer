You are the book factory chapter-reviewer, a fresh isolated role call.

Follow this contract exactly:

# Chapter reviewer

You are a factory component, not a judge. You never see a reference book
or any judge prompt. You check one draft against its plan card and a
word-budget line the orchestrator computed. Your job is to make the
writer produce the best chapter the card allows — landed argument, paid
jobs, verbatim assignments, honest evidence bounds — not only length.

## Inputs (exactly these)

1. The accepted master plan
2. This chapter's card
3. The draft chapter
4. One line: `Delivered N words. Budget B.`

## Output

Start with exactly `ACCEPT` or `REVISE`.

Then at most 7 findings. Each finding is one of:

- `JOB` — the card's primary job is missing, or the chapter continues into a reserved-later job
- `MANTRA` — a card-assigned mantra/token is not present verbatim
- `INSTRUCTION` — a card-assigned new instruction is not present verbatim
- `ID` — a card-cited ID is unresolved or invented
- `LENGTHEN to B±15%` — delivered words are below 0.85 × B
- `SHORTEN to B±15%` — delivered words are above 1.15 × B
- `HEADER` — the draft opens with the workshop header `IN THIS CHAPTER`, or it prints a numbered plan-index with no spoken body. A numbered ALL-CAPS instruction plus one spoken rationale line is not `HEADER`.
- `STOPPED-SHORT` — the card's primary job is argued but never landed as a flat verdict before SUMMARY. The reader can still hold the entering belief. Quote the missing landing.
- `UNASSIGNED-REFRAIN` — a non-mantra phrase recurs ≥3× verbatim. Name the phrase and the count. Subtract repeats; do not invent a new mantra.
- `RESERVED-REACH` — the draft performs a later chapter's primary job. Name that later card and cut the overreach to at most one sentence.
- `RE-ARGUMENT` — the draft rebuilds settled work as its own section: a scene whose debut staging belongs to an earlier card, an earlier card's belief-now or primary job argued again with evidence and a turn, or an earlier card's instruction re-explained. Mantra lines, one-phrase token echoes, and a one-sentence hand-off are not `RE-ARGUMENT`. Name the earlier card and quote the rebuilt section's heading or first line; cut the section to at most one sentence that speaks the settled token. If that cut leaves the chapter below 0.85 × B, the words that replace it must extend this card's own encounter and evidence, never an earlier card's.
- `OVERCLAIM` — a claim exceeds the permitted-inference line of the evidence-ledger entry the card routes. Quote the overclaim and the bound in the review. Require the writer to delete the unsupported claim or narrow the sentence to what the evidence actually supports, rather than append commentary about the evidence, its scope, or what it can establish. The bound governs the repair; it is not text to transplant into the chapter. Retain any qualification needed for factual accuracy or reader safety, expressed directly in ordinary language; never remove a necessary limitation merely to sound certain, and never print the ledger ID or grade in prose.

No other finding types. No style notes. No "sounds like AI." No comparison
to any other book. No warmth, tone, or voice coaching.

`ACCEPT` only when every check above is fine (length inside ±15% of B, job
done and stopped and landed, assigned mantras/instructions verbatim, IDs
resolved, no `HEADER`, no unassigned refrain, no reserved-later job, no
re-argument, no overclaim).

`REVISE` when any check fails. List the findings. Be specific: quote the
missing job, the missing wording, or the overclaim.

## Rules

- Do not rewrite the chapter yourself.
- Do not invent a word budget. Use B from the orchestrator line.
- Do not ask for another review round. The orchestrator decides whether
  there is another rewrite (up to three).
- When you demand more words, make the LENGTHEN finding an expansion assignment, not merely a quotation of the card's job: identify a specific unfinished encounter, unanswered objection, or undeveloped consequence belonging to this card, quote the draft location to extend, and state what new understanding or lived consequence that extension must deliver. Check that target against earlier cards and against conclusions already landed in this draft; neither an earlier proof in a new setting nor another proof of the same landed conclusion is a valid expansion target. For an ordinary-life card, extend what happens next with the settled understanding already assumed, not how that understanding is proved again. If you cannot identify an unspent target supported by the card and plan, report that limitation within LENGTHEN rather than inventing evidence or requesting generic additional examples; retain the computed budget and the existing ACCEPT requirements.
- Your entire reply IS the review.

Delivered 4190 words. Budget 4500.

# Master Plan — Quit Smoking
`production-books/quit-smoking/master-plan.md`

## 1. Book Core

- target behavior: compulsive cigarette smoking. Total stop at a last cigarette, then none. Not cutting down, not vaping as destination, not NRT as method.
- reader state: an adult daily smoker, years inside the trap, smoking to get through stress, breaks, meals and nights out, failed by willpower, patches or cold turkey, privately sure life without cigarettes would be flat or impossible yet lighting the next one within the hour.
- load-bearing false belief, frozen: Cigarettes relax me, help me cope and are my pleasure, and life without them would mean deprivation.
- through-line: every cigarette never gave, only took; seeing the taking clearly makes stopping an escape into clean air, not a sacrifice of a friend.
- format: full-length belief-changer, 14 chapters, about 60,000 words, last cigarette ritual then ordinary life then short recap.
- Fork 1 — inner monster: full Carr personification. The trivial physical creature to starve is the Nipper, M-D. The belief-system that feeds it is the Smokescreen, M-E. Craving is external, small, already dying; the belief is the real target.
- Fork 2 — outcome: total cessation, commanded with cheerful certainty. Moderation foreclosed by pincer and cliff logic. No autonomy to keep smoking safely.
- Fork 3 — science weight: Carr's own position. Nicotine pharmacology and industry documents delivered flat and frightening where true, then disowned as motive; change from escape-joy, not fear. No literature-review texture. Honour limits by not overclaiming.
- Fork 4 — villain: two villains hit hard. The nicotine trap and industry that built it, and the Willpower Method that kept the reader in it. Warm to the person, vicious to the trap and the wrong method.
- Fork 5 — void: natural baseline. Change nothing else in life. The non-smoker body returns to breathing, tasting and calm attention on its own. No replacement ritual as method.
- redefinition / margin: none. Smoking is not split into a Good-X / Bad-X line; no CAPS redefinition, no dose buffer. A slip is a rumble strip for belief, never a licensed puff; guard the belief, not the behaviour with a margin.
- safety perimeter: routed to CA-SAFE. No medical advice, no instruction to ignore a doctor, crisis or illness pointers only, last-cigarette ritual ceremonial not a dare to smoke more.
- strongest pro-behaviour scene: SC-A, late-night patio with friends and drinks, offered cigarette, one won't hurt.
- destination state: whenever the reader thinks of a cigarette they feel relief and freedom that they no longer smoke, happy to be free from day one.
- saved ending reframe, appears only in C14: the ashtray was already empty — you were the one who kept refilling it, and now you have put the habit down like a borrowed coat that was never yours.
- method fidelity: escape not sacrifice, warm to person and vicious to trap, no willpower, fear raised at full force then disowned by escape where assigned, immediate freedom after belief change, original prose, Fork-1 personification throughout.

## 2. Compact Evidence Ledger

E-01 — lived off-switch
- finding: smoker credits rapid taken-care-of feeling to cigarette after stress.
- reader line, exact: "If anything stressful happens in my life, a cigarette takes care of it."
- unit: LEU-001
- source: S-001
- grade: lived account — n/a, no clinical grade
- scope and context: adult smoker, stressful moment, hand already reaching.
- permitted inference: the smoker experiences a rapid "taken care of" feeling and credits the cigarette; the same writer can know the credit is false and still feel the relief.
- prohibited inference: that cigarettes treat the underlying problem, or that stress without a cigarette is medically dangerous.
- empirical limit: single-situation account; does not establish mechanism or prevalence beyond described encounter.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-02 — lived social offer
- finding: night-out scene plus drinking collapses social-smoker rule into exception.
- reader line, exact: "You often get offered a cigarette and in that kind of environment it's hard to turn down. You don't want to be the only one not smoking and because you've been drinking, you don't think about the risks, you think one won't hurt."
- unit: LEU-002
- source: S-051
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: night out, smoking area, friends lighting up, alcohol on board.
- permitted inference: the social scene plus drinking is named as the moment the "social smoker" rule collapses into "one won't hurt."
- prohibited inference: that the reader must avoid all friends or all alcohol as the method of quitting.
- empirical limit: single-situation account; does not prescribe social avoidance.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-03 — lived twenty attempts
- finding: years of replacements and willpower attempts with expected failure.
- reader line, exact: "I had probably attempted at least twenty times before and used most of the replacements and meds on the market with no success."
- unit: LEU-003
- source: S-006
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: failed-quitter history, patches, gum, cold turkey.
- permitted inference: repeated failed attempts with replacements and willpower are typical in this community, not proof the reader is uniquely weak.
- prohibited inference: that nobody ever quits, or that replacements must be used, or that they must never be used.
- empirical limit: community typicality as described; not a trial efficacy claim.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-04 — lived heaven then shame
- finding: lighting-up called heaven, aftertaste shame, unwilling to give up lighting.
- reader line, exact: "the moment I light up I'm in heaven, but feel shitty afterwards. So whilst I love smoking I hate being a smoker"
- unit: LEU-004
- source: S-013
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: moment of lighting, then aftertaste.
- permitted inference: "I enjoy it" can coexist with hating the identity of being a smoker; enjoyment is named at the moment of lighting, not as a day-long gift.
- prohibited inference: that the reader is lying about enjoyment, or that enjoyment must be mocked.
- empirical limit: moment-specific account; not a day-long benefit proof.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-05 — lived reward for everything
- finding: cigarette attached as payment to almost any finished act.
- reader line, exact: "Cigarettes were my reward for…well, almost everything. Teaching a class. Finishing a story. Finishing a paragraph. Driving 500 miles. Driving to the grocery store."
- unit: LEU-005
- source: S-045
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: work finish, drive, errand, day structured as pellets.
- permitted inference: the "reward" can attach to almost any completed act; the party is the cigarette, not the work.
- prohibited inference: that work or driving requires nicotine, or that quitting means life has no celebrations.
- empirical limit: single-pattern account; does not prove work needs nicotine.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-06 — lived just one after months
- finding: long quit undone by moderate-voice offer of one.
- reader line, exact: "I know I can never have just one. I learned that the hard way, thinking after 5 months I could control myself and just have one. Nope."
- unit: LEU-006
- source: S-006
- grade: lived account — n/a
- scope and context: five months smoke-free, control illusion, chain back.
- permitted inference: a long quit does not make "just one" safe; the smoker who learned this the hard way names it as never.
- prohibited inference: that a slip dooms the reader forever if the belief is not let back in; no dare to test "just one."
- empirical limit: single-case warning; not a doom sentence if belief is guarded.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-07 — ten-second hit and rapid fade
- finding: smoked nicotine peaks in brain within seconds, acute effects dissipate quickly, driving redosing.
- reader line, exact: "When cigarette smoke enters the lungs, nicotine is absorbed rapidly in the blood and delivered quickly to the brain, so that nicotine levels peak within 10 seconds of inhalation. But the acute effects of nicotine also dissipate quickly, along with the associated feelings of reward; this rapid cycle causes the smoker to continue dosing to maintain the drug's pleasurable effects and prevent withdrawal symptoms."
- unit: SEU-001
- source: S-009
- grade: SUPPORTED
- scope and context: smoked nicotine pharmacokinetics, puff timing.
- permitted inference: the "relief" is replenishment of a rapidly fading dose, not a gift that solves the original stress.
- prohibited inference: every puff is a unique pleasure; "you cannot quit."
- empirical limit: smoked nicotine pharmacokinetics; describes typical cycle, not every puff as unique pleasure.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-08 — product is nicotine
- finding: internal industry definition of cigarette as nicotine package.
- reader line, exact: "The cigarette should be conceived not as a product but as a package. the product is nicotine."
- unit: SEU-002
- source: S-091
- grade: SUPPORTED (historical industry document)
- scope and context: manufacturer layer view, pack and puff as dispenser.
- permitted inference: an industry scientist defined the cigarette as a nicotine package and dispenser, not as a flavour accessory.
- prohibited inference: quoting an internal memo as if it were a public-health consensus paper, or as a dare to smoke more to "see the product."
- empirical limit: internal research planning memo, not a consumer brochure or clinical trial.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-09 — lights do not cut dose
- finding: ventilated light cigarettes do not reduce human intake; compensation with bigger puffs.
- reader line: ventilated/"light" cigarettes do not reduce human intake; smokers compensate with bigger puffs.
- unit: SEU-003
- sources: S-010, S-080, S-089
- grade: SUPPORTED
- scope and context: human smoking versus machine measurement.
- permitted inference: machine-measured lower tar/nicotine does not mean the smoker took less; compensation is the designed human response to a nicotine-seeking dose.
- prohibited inference: every smoker compensates identically, or that unventilated cigarettes are a harm-reduction recommendation.
- empirical limit: human smoking vs FTC-style machines; not identical compensation for every smoker.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-10 — NRT trial odds vs actual attempts
- finding: licensed NRT raises trial abstinence vs control, while most real attempts are unassisted with low single-attempt success.
- reader line: licensed NRT vs control raises 6+ month abstinence (pooled RR 1.55); most smokers who try to quit do so unassisted, with unaided success around 7–8%.
- unit: SEU-004
- sources: S-077, S-078
- grade: CONTESTED as a single slogan; both component facts SUPPORTED in their own scopes
- scope and context: motivated trial quitters versus population attempts; different questions.
- permitted inference: NRT can raise odds versus placebo in trials; most attempts are still unmedicated; neither fact means the reader cannot quit, and neither fact is a prescription.
- prohibited inference: "you cannot quit without patches" or "cold turkey never works." The two statistics answer different questions and must not be collapsed.
- empirical limit: motivated trial quitters, not all smokers; population attempts, not lifetime; not a guarantee and not proof nobody quits without help.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

E-11 — withdrawal short peak
- finding: withdrawal restlessness with short typical peak then easing.
- reader line: withdrawal symptoms typically peak in the first few days and usually subside within a few weeks; they may begin within hours; MedlinePlus places the sharpest edge about 2–3 days after last use.
- unit: SEU-005
- sources: S-009, S-081
- grade: SUPPORTED (population typical, not every reader)
- scope and context: day two or three without cigarette, irritability and craving.
- permitted inference: the restless empty feeling is withdrawal pharmacology with a short typical peak, not proof the cigarette was the real self.
- prohibited inference: withdrawal is weeks of physical torture for everyone, or that it is harmless for every person in every circumstance.
- empirical limit: population typical, not every reader; dependent users vary; genetics influence severity; does not negate rare complications.
- safety limit: No medical advice. No instruction to ignore a doctor. Crisis/illness pointers only. Last-cigarette ritual is ceremonial, not a dare to smoke more.

> If you live with a medical condition, take prescribed medication, feel ill, feel severe distress, or worry about stopping, speak to a clinician for personal care. This book changes what you believe smoking gives you; it does not give medical advice and does not ask you to ignore a doctor.

## 6. Arc and Length

Architecture: 14 chapters. C01 contract and hook. C02 trap first seen with creatures in passing and body encounters. C03 axis switch. C04–C07 demolitions and mechanism deepening on installed ground. C08 inhabit ordinary doing. C09 widen indictment plus fear. C10 strongest case plus embedded testimony. C11 escape routes plus myths battery and meta-inoculation. C12 last ordinary instance and vow. C13 ordinary life with owned thoughts once. C14 short photographable recap and outward push.

- concept debuts: contract C01; trap and creatures and sensory C02; TO/FOR C03; ease clause C04; off-switch kill C04; reward and lights kill C05; anti-method C06; inversion deepening C07; inhabit C08; villain dossier and tug-of-war and cost triple C09; strongest case C10; just-one and myths C11; terminal mantra and vow C12; ordinary life C13; ending reframe C14 only.
- demolition curve: low C01, rising C03–C05, peak C06–C11, handing to freedom after C12.
- freedom crescendo: promise C01, suppressed C04–C09 to let demolition work, rising C10–C11, detonated C12–C14 with more freedom language than rest combined.

### The draft chapter
```
Chapter 6
WHY WILLPOWER NEVER WORKED

*You did not fail those tries because you are weak — those tries failed because they left the want alive.*

### THE DRAWER

Open that drawer you know.

Half a card of gum, foil pushed through and left. Two patches curled at the edge where the packet said peel here. A lighter you swore you would not need. A calendar on the side with good crosses through Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, then a blank Thursday and a fresh start pencilled for next Monday. Under it the fear of the next try.

We have all owned that drawer. I owned it.

The top layer is tidy. That is the giveaway. Gum lined up like ammunition. Patch packets squared. A folded leaflet with a chart. Underneath is the mess — receipts, an empty pack kept for no reason, a broken lighter, a list of reasons written at midnight and never read again. The drawer is not a quit kit. It is a museum of torn orders.

"I had probably attempted at least twenty times before and used most of the replacements and meds on the market with no success."

I hear that sentence often, in different mouths with the same shame in it. Twenty times. Patches. Gum. White-knuckle weeks. Cold Mondays. The same clock bringing the same hand back to the pocket.

Let me ask you plainly, as one smoker to another, because you have carried this blame long enough.

If twenty failures proved weakness, how did the same weak person keep a job, pay rent, raise children, sit through night shifts and funerals and debts without folding? If you lacked will, how did you keep smoking through cough and cost and stairs that left you short and mornings that left you ashamed? Does that look like no will to you?

Think of what staying a smoker actually takes. It takes getting up in rain to find a shop open. It takes standing outside in January while everyone else stays inside. It takes swallowing the taste after a sore throat and lighting again. It takes paying week after week for something that leaves you shorter of breath and shorter of money. It takes looking your child in the eye after Febreezing the hallway and doing it again the next day.

Is that the resumé of a soft person?

It takes a stubborn will to keep doing something that goes against every instinct of the body. You are not weak-willed. You are wilful — wilful enough to keep paying, puffing, hiding, coughing and starting again. The will was never missing. It was pointed at defending a con.

We were conned, you and I, twice over. Once by the tube. Once by the way we were told to leave the tube.

Look at the calendar again. Monday cross. Tuesday cross. Wednesday cross neat and proud. Thursday blank. What happened on Thursday? Not a collapse of character. A human week happened. A row with your wife. A late bill. A good laugh in the pub. A long drive. A dull Sunday. The orders you were given had no room for a human week. They said want it and deny yourself it at the same time, count what you miss, mark the days you miss it. Thursday did not break you. Thursday showed the orders could not hold a life.

And under the calendar, that fear of the next try. It is not fear of the tube. You know the tube. It is fear of the weeks — the staring at the clock, the snapping at people you love, the going to bed early to get the day over, the waking up to do it again. You are not afraid to stop. You are afraid to go through that again.

You should not have to. That was never the way out. That was the bar with the stools bolted down.

### THE METHOD THAT MAKES IT HARD

Look at what the Willpower Method actually asks you to do.

It tells you the cigarette is your pleasure, your crutch, your reward — and then tells you to grit your teeth and live without your pleasure by force. It tells you to count days, to watch the clock, to tell yourself you are denying yourself, to feel deprived and call the deprivation proof you are doing well. It gives you no finish line. Day one is hard. Day seven is hard with pride. Day thirty is hard with fear that you will always feel hard.

Do you see what that does?

It leaves the brainwashing whole — cigarettes help, cigarettes please, life will be flat without them — and then demands you live against that belief by strain. Of course you strain. Of course the mind begs. Of course one bad afternoon or one bright night out is enough to tip the scale. The struggle was not in you. The struggle was built into the orders.

That is why the history in your calendar is not a history of your character. It is a history of a method that manufactures the very fight it pretends to test. Put any strong, wilful human inside orders that say want it and deny yourself it at the same time, and you get the same torn weeks, the same secret puffs, the same shame. Not because humans are weak. Because torn orders tear.

I want you to see the machinery, because once seen you cannot blame yourself for it again.

First the method raises the price. Forbid a supposed pleasure and every thought of it gets heavier. Tell a man he can never have his little reward again and the little reward stops being little. It becomes the thing in the corner of every room. The diet makes the cake bigger. The vow makes the tube bigger. Not because the tube grew. Because the forbidding lit it up.

Then the method sets you to counting. Day one. Day three. Three weeks, two days, four hours. What are you counting? Not freedom. You are counting distance from something you still believe you want. Each cross says I have not had it, not I do not want it. The calendar on your drawer is not a record of strength. It is a record of missing, kept daily, rehearsed nightly.

Then the method leaves you with no end. When is a willpower quitter cured? After a month? A year? Three years? Ask the man who still says after three years that he would love one with a pint. He won by strain and he knows he is still in the fight. There is no finish line in that race because the want was never removed. With the Willpower Method there is no finish line, only a longer and longer corridor of missing.

Ask the questions that close this door, and answer honest.

If the method worked, why did every try feel like waiting for something to end that never ended? If lack of backbone was the cause, why did the hardest, most stubborn people you know — miners, nurses, soldiers, mothers of four — sit in the same drawer with the same curled patches? If suffering proved progress, why did more suffering only make the next dose taste more precious?

You know the answers. The tries felt endless because they were endless by design. The stubborn failed with the timid because the orders failed both. The suffering made the tube precious because forbidding a supposed pleasure always makes it precious.

You did not fail. The method failed.

All you have to do is follow all the instructions.

That sentence is not a pat on the back. It is the whole difference. The old orders said hold the belief and fight yourself. These orders say mend the belief and there is no fight. One asks for strain. The other asks for eyes.

### THE DIFFERENT GLASS

Now look at the props in that drawer with clear eyes.

Gum. Patch. Thin white stick that lights with a hiss. Different packet, different price, different hand to mouth. The talk around them says cleaner, modern, sensible step-down.

Picture a bar you know. Late. Wood rung. A man tells himself whisky is ruining his mornings, so he will be strict and switch to brandy. Same bar. Same stool. Same raising of the glass at the same hour for the same tug in the chest. New label. New talk. New price on the tab.

Has he left the bar? Or has he ordered the same drink in a changed glass and called the change a way out?

That is what the swap does. The tube was sold as flavour and company. The packet said nicotine by another name. The gum and patch and vapour say nicotine by another route. The hand learns a new grip. The mouth learns a new chew. The chest still waits for its accustomed hit at its accustomed minute, and the mind still believes a dose is what quiets the tug the doses made. Same stool. Changed glass.

I am not mocking anyone who reached for those props. We all reached. When you believe you need a prop to stand, you grab what the shelf offers. I grabbed. You grabbed.

But watch what the props prove about the belief, not about your backbone.

Did one piece of gum ever close an afternoon the way food closes hunger? Did one patch ever make the teaching break bright or the paragraph sing? Or did the day keep its same clock — quiet for an hour, whine by the next — with a new arithmetic laid over it: how many pieces, how strong a patch, how many puffs of the new stick, and the old packet still counted in the head?

You lived it. The want kept its hours because the belief kept its seat. Change the glass and the bar stays open.

Look closer at that arithmetic, because it is where the weeks went.

With the tube the sums were simple: how many left, will it last till night, where to buy. With the props the sums double. How many pieces chewed, how long between, can I chew and smoke, how strong a patch, where to stick it, can I sleep in it, how many puffs of the new stick equal one old one. Morning starts with sticking and chewing instead of lighting, but the mind is still on dosing. Evening ends with counting a different packet, but the mind is still counting. The hands are busier. The belief is untouched.

Would you call a man out of debt because he moved the debt to a new card? Would you call him cured because the Collected stamps are a different colour?

There are two numbers you will hear thrown at you, and I want you to hold them apart because the sellers and the scolders love to weld them together.

In formal trials, where motivated quitters were given nicotine products against a dummy for comparison, more of those with the product stayed off for six months and beyond — about half again as many. That is a trial answer, from trial rooms, with picked volunteers and counted weeks.

Out in ordinary streets, most tries are made bare-handed, with nothing chewed or stuck on, and only a small handful in a hundred hold on any single bare-handed try. That is a street answer, from ordinary calendars like yours.

Different people. Different questions. Neither number is your sentence, and neither tells you what you must put in your mouth. If you live with illness or take prescribed medicine, see your clinician for that care — this book settles what the dose gives, nothing else.

What both numbers prove together is simpler than any lecture. Bare-handed tries under torn orders mostly fall. Propped tries under the same torn orders fall only a little less often. The common piece is not your mouth. It is the orders. Mend the belief and the mouth follows without a prop and without a fight.

Would you call a man free because he changed seats in the same cage? Would you call him weak because he rattled the new bars too?

### THE MONDAY WITHOUT A SCOREBOARD

Now let us talk about that pencilled Monday, because it is still there on the calendar and it is doing work on you.

Next Monday. Fresh start. The old meaning of those words is all strain. Tell everyone at work. Lay out the gum in a row. Stick the first patch on with ceremony. Draw the chart. Cross Monday by will. White-knuckle to Friday. Tell yourself missing is healing. Wait for the want to fade while still believing the thing wanted was a pleasure.

Do you feel the tiredness just reading that? That tiredness is not laziness. It is memory. Your body remembers fourteen minutes of holding and counting and dulling from the priced day, and it remembers weeks of counting missing on top. Of course the chest tightens at the thought of another try.

The Monday under these orders is not a test. There is no badge to earn and no score to keep.

Watch what the same wilful drawer-owner does when he stops borrowing the old meaning.

He wakes on Monday and does not announce. He does not tell the office, he does not warn his wife to be patient, he does not clear the diary for suffering. Announcing made every past try a performance — eyes on him, questions at lunch, shame if Thursday went blank. He has no performance now. He has an argument to finish.

He does not draw crosses. The crosses were the method made visible — I have missed it for one day, for two days, look how long I can miss it. He does not need a record of missing because he is not practising missing. He is practising seeing. Monday is not Day One of denial. It is Monday, with teaching and paragraph and shops and tea, watched with clear eyes.

He does not brace the evening. The old bracing went like this: Friday will be hard, the pub will be hard, the row will be hard, so hold tight. Bracing assumes the tube gave something Friday needs. He has priced Friday already. The teaching tiredness, the sentence click, the stocked step — all done by him, all paid at booths that took more than they gave. He does not need to hold tight against Friday. He needs to watch Friday prove what teaching and sentence and shops already proved.

Ask yourself which Monday asks more of you.

Which takes more effort — to remember every hour that you must not have something you still believe helps, or to notice, hour by hour, that the help never came from the tube? Which is heavier — to carry a chart and a count and a secret hunger through a human week, or to carry eyes that check each claim against your own morning? Which have you already done twenty times, and which have you never been allowed to try?

You know. The heavy Monday was the borrowed one.

I know this is hard to accept at first, because the scoreboard felt like seriousness. No crosses felt like not trying. But the scoreboard never measured trying. It measured missing. A man who stops counting missing has not gone soft. He has stopped rehearsing want.

All you have to do is follow all the instructions.

That is how the instruction lives on a Monday. Not as a slogan on the fridge. As a quiet refusal to restart the old paperwork. No Day One. No tally. No telling the world to watch you suffer. Just the next page, the next priced minute, the next claim checked against your own hands.

### THE DRAWER LEFT SHUT

And the props. What does he do with the gum and the curling patches and the bright new stick?

He does not need a ceremony. The Willpower Method loves ceremony — bin the packets with shaking hands, snap the last tube, photograph the drawer emptied, swear on the bin. Ceremony says leaving is loss and loss needs ritual pain. He has no loss to bury.

He leaves the drawer shut and gets on with the day.

Notice what that means in practice, because this is where disregard becomes hands and feet, not theory.

He does not start the morning with prop-arithmetic. No choosing a strength, no cutting a patch in half, no counting pieces for the drive, no wondering if two chews equal one puff. The arithmetic was the bar staying open under new prices. He does not do new prices. He watches the clock he knows — quiet for an hour, tug by the next — and remembers what that clock is. Not a need for brandy after whisky. The fading of a dose that will fade whether the next dose comes by paper or by gum or by vapour.

He does not carry a spare prop for courage. The spare was the old safety net — gum in the coat, patch in the wallet, new stick charged just in case. The spare said I believe I will need a dose to get through teaching, paragraph, shops. He has watched teaching close without a booth, paragraph click before the match, shelves fill before the flare. He does not need courage in foil. He needs the memory of his own hands doing it.

He does not test himself against the drawer. He does not open it to sniff and prove he does not want it, he does not stand in the shop to stare at the shelf to prove character. Testing is the old game — put the pleasure under your nose and show you can deny it. He is not denying a pleasure. He is seeing a con. You do not test yourself against a con you have seen. You walk past the shell game without stopping because you know where the pea is.

If you take prescribed medicine or live with illness, that care stays with your clinician. This is not medical advice and this book does not ask you to ignore a doctor. What stays here, in this drawer, is the belief question: did any glass ever change the bar? Watch your own afternoons answer. The gum afternoons kept the same hours. The patch mornings kept the same tug. The vapour evenings kept the same counting. Different grip. Same stool.

Would you keep paying the tab because the glass was changed? Would you keep the spare key because you once believed you were locked in?

Leave the drawer shut and the question answers itself by Thursday. Not by crosses. By hours that kept their shape without arithmetic. Teaching done. Sentence clicked. Bags carried. No pieces counted. No strengths chosen. No spare fondled. The day did not need propping because the day was never held up by the tube.

### WHEN THEY OFFER YOU THEIR STRUGGLE

It will come, perhaps as early as Monday tea break. It always comes to a smoker who stops counting.

The bragger leans on the machine. Big voice. Big chest.

"I did it by willpower. Three months of hell. I just decided. You've got to want it enough."

The whinger shakes his head by the kettle.

"Don't kid yourself. It's terrible. Three years and I still want one with coffee. You'll be climbing the walls."

Same method. Different noise. Both still speak of the tube as a pleasure they deny themselves. Both invite you to borrow their struggle as proof of seriousness.

The old you borrowed. We all borrowed. You took the bragger's hardness as a rebuke and the whinger's warning as a prophecy, and both made the next dose more precious. If he suffered so much to leave it, it must be precious. If he still wants it after years, it must be precious. Borrowed struggle always gilds the cage.

Disregard lives differently, and it is kinder than arguing.

You do not correct him. You do not preach. You do not tell him about traps and glasses and booths while he holds his mug. Arguing would drag you back into defending an argument you have not finished reading. It would make you a preacher of missing, and preaching missing rebuilds missing.

You listen, you smile, you keep your own counsel.

Inside, you translate. Not with contempt — warm to the person, always — but with clear eyes for the method.

He says hell and you hear orders. He says want it enough and you hear want it and deny it at the same time. He says climbing the walls and you hear counting missing for three years. You do not need his weeks to know your Monday. You have your own priced day. Your own teaching tiredness. Your own sentence click. Your own hand covering vent holes it never meant to cover.

Ask the silent questions that keep you straight, and let them answer themselves.

If his hardness proved the tube was precious, why did hardness never make the tube less wanted, only more watched? If her years of missing proved leaving is suffering, why would you borrow suffering to prove seriousness when seeing removes the need to suffer? If both still speak of pleasure denied, whose victory would you be borrowing — the boast or the weep?

You know. Neither.

Disregard is not rudeness. It is keeping the eyes you were given. Let his story stay his story. Yours is not a harder version of his weeks. Yours is a different road where the booths are seen and passed. All you have to do is follow all the instructions — not his instructions, shouted by the machine, but these, read in order, checked against your own hands.

That is the new understanding the drawer never gave you. The old tries failed in company — everyone watching, everyone advising, everyone counting. This one succeeds in quiet company of your own witnessing. The whinger can whinge. The bragger can boast. The calendar can stay blank. The drawer can stay shut. Monday can stay Monday.

You are not borrowing struggle. You are returning it, unopened, with thanks.

### WILFUL, NOT WEAK

"But I know a man who quit by sheer will. He suffered for months and now he never touches them. Are you saying he lied?"

No. I am saying look at what he paid, and look at what he still pays.

We all know two characters. The bragger who tells you how much he wanted it and how he crushed it by character. The whinger who tells you how terrible it was and how he still wants one after three years. Same method. Same belief left alive. One boasts about the strain. One weeps about the strain. Both still speak of the tube as a pleasure they deny themselves. Both keep the con alive by the way they describe the victory.

Do you want their victory? A life of remembering a pleasure you must never touch?

And you will hear another voice, quieter, aimed at this very book.

"Isn't this just brainwashing in the other direction?"

Fair question. Answer it with eyes open. Brainwashing asks you to believe without checking. It shows you pale packs and smooth words and tells you not to look at the vent holes. It shows you parties and tells you not to look at who taught and wrote and drove. What have I asked you to do here? Look. Price the day. Watch the hand cover the holes. Taste the sentence before the match. Check every claim against your own teaching morning and your own paragraph and your own drive. A con fears your eyes. The truth asks for them.

That is the difference between being told and seeing. One needs your trust. The other needs your attention.

So let the old blame go where it belongs. You were not too soft for the method. The method was too false for a wilful person to live inside. It told you to want and to deny in the same breath, to count what you miss, to sit in the bar with a changed glass and call it leaving.

It never tested your will. It spent your will.

6. DISREGARD ANYONE WHO QUIT BY WILLPOWER
Their struggle was the method, not you.

**SUMMARY**
- The drawer of gum, patches, crosses and fresh Mondays proves a false method was used again and again, not a weak person failing again and again.
- The Willpower Method leaves the belief that the dose pleases and supports untouched, then orders a life against that belief, so strain, counting and endless waiting are built in.
- Gum, patch and vapour are the same drink in a changed glass, keeping the same hour and the same tug while teaching a new grip.
- Trial counts and street counts answer different questions about different people, and neither count decides what your belief can do now.
- Will that kept smoking through cough, cost and shame is strong, wilful stuff pointed the wrong way, and pointed straight it walks out without a fight.
